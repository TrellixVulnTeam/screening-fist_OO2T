# lab notes

## echo exp. design
see [design](design) - differs from prev in that blocks go horizontal now. Used 96 herbicide-like compounds from the FDA lib. one ldv echo plate can accomodate 96 compounds x 4 experiments (including blank). Used 48 µl of each - need to be careful, might not fit another 4 experiments with many of them. DMSO was in 384pp plate, will keep doing that. Different picklist files for DMSO and cpd plates - they require different inserts. 8 plates took 3 hours in the echo.

### todo
- put compounds away, mark finished.
- order more ldv plates

## protein
- some went to waste - unless i flash freeze?
- filtered 0.1% BSA 100 mM KPi pH7 with 0.45 µm and degassed. 
- used electric pipette to dispense, loose tips in a couple runs - didn't note which - should be able to see over & under dispensing.
- over dispensed in final col for one run because i took up extra, won't do that again.

### todo 
- flash freeze - 

### platereader
- 9 mins / plate including data transfer
- centrifuge availability - need to negotiate better - secondary centrifuge screen not working
- ppms booking - had to rebook yday, mine disappeared. so did hanahn's - we clashed.
