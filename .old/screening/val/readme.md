# assay validation

## aim:
answer:
- does BSA interfere with kd?
- do assay measurements correspond with literature affinities?

## bsa
bsa binds some small, hydrophobic molecules which can interfere with the assay. it can also stablize the assay.
- what sorts of small compounds does it bind (from fda lib, diversity sample)
- how much does it really stablize the assay 


### diversity sample 24 cpds (1 plate) from fda 
 todo
### 3 plates
- 0.1% bsa 
- no bsa
- blank 
- time course too

## accuracy
- Pearsons correlation coefficient with literature measurements (wt and dm)
- correlation?
- is rank the same?
