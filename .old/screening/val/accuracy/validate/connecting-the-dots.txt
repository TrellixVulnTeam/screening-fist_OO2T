P450BM3 (CYP102A1): connecting the dots
Christopher J. C. Whitehouse, Stephen G. Bell and Luet-Lok Wong*
Received 18th July 2011
DOI: 10.1039/c1cs15192d
P450BM3 (CYP102A1), a fatty acid hydroxylase from Bacillus megaterium, has been extensively
studied over a period of almost forty years. The enzyme has been redesigned to catalyse the
oxidation of non-natural substrates as diverse as pharmaceuticals, terpenes and gaseous alkanes
using a variety of engineering strategies. Crystal structures have provided a basis for several
of the catalytic eﬀects brought about by mutagenesis, while changes to reduction potentials,
inter-domain electron transfer rates and catalytic parameters have yielded functional insights.
Areas of active research interest include drug metabolite production, the development of
process-scale techniques, unravelling general mechanistic aspects of P450 chemistry, methane
oxidation, and improving selectivity control to allow the synthesis of ﬁne chemicals. This review
draws together the disparate research themes and places them in a historical context with the
aim of creating a resource that can be used as a gateway to the ﬁeld.

Introduction

P450BM3 (CYP102A1) belongs to the P450 cytochrome (CYP)
superfamily of haem b-dependent monooxygenases, members
of which are found in virtually every organism. P450 enzymes
have a highly conserved tertiary structure and share a characteristic protein fold, but only one amino acid is invariant—the
cysteine residue to which the prosthetic group is axially ligated.1

The CO-bound ferrous form of the enzyme has a distinctive
450 nm absorption band from which the superfamily takes its
name. The human genome project has so far identiﬁed 63 human
P450 genes, and there are as many as 286 in the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.2 Prokaryotes are less well represented: Escherichia coli,
in which P450s are usually expressed for research purposes, has
none, while Mycobacterium tuberculosis has ca. 20.3 P450s are
also found in archaea such as Sulfolobus solfataricus, suggesting
they are of ancient origin.4 One possibility is that they evolved in
response to the toxicity risk posed by rising planetary dioxygen
levels and had functions that revolved around the lipids that
formed the cell membranes of early microbes.
P450s catalyse the oxidation of a broad array of endogenous
and exogenous organic substrates, allowing them to perform

physiological roles as varied as steroid hormone synthesis in
mammals, and herbicide resistance in plants. They are best known
for breaking down xenobiotics—including pharmaceuticals—in
humans, but also defend insects against plant toxins, feature
prominently in the metabolic and synthetic pathways of bacteria
where present, and are involved in the synthesis of antibiotics
in bacteria and fungi. Those with anabolic functions are often
substrate-speciﬁc, but others—notably those involved in the
detoxiﬁcation and metabolism of xenobiotics—are more promiscuous, versatility being an asset in such roles. The signature
reaction of a P450 is the insertion of a single oxygen atom from
molecular dioxygen into a carbon–hydrogen bond to give the
corresponding alcohol, the second oxygen atom being reduced
to water. Other activity types include oleﬁn epoxidation, ring

expansion, heteroatom oxidation and dealkylation, and dehydrogenation across C–O, C–N and C–C bonds, as well as carbon–
carbon bond formation and cleavage.5
1.2 The catalytic cycle
The P450 catalytic cycle, which is shown in Fig. 1, has been
widely studied and extensively debated, as a result of which the
details are now broadly agreed. In the resting state (I), the
ferric iron atom is six-coordinate, the porphyrin system supplying four equatorial nitrogen ligands, while a water ligand
occupies the axial position trans to the proximal thiolato ligand.
The arrival of a viable substrate in the active site results in the
loss of the axial water ligand (II), whether through direct displacement or in response to induced conformational changes.
This causes the ferric spin state to increase from S = 1/2 (lowspin) to S = 5/2 (high-spin), a transition that can be monitored
spectrophotometrically since the Soret band, which arises from a
p - p* electronic transition in the delocalised p system of the
porphyrin ring, undergoes a blue or ‘‘type I’’ shift from ca. 418 nm
to ca. 390 nm. At the same time, the haem reduction potential
becomes more oxidising. A single electron supplied almost invariably by a reduced pyridine nucleotide (NADH or NADPH) is
shuttled to the haem iron via electron transfer partners, reducing
it to the ferrous state (III), whereupon dioxygen binds to yield
an oxy-complex (IV). A second electron is transferred, creating a
ferric peroxy complex (V). Protonation of the terminal oxygen
atom gives ‘‘Compound 0’’, a hydroperoxy adduct (VI). A
second protonation triggers water loss via the heterolytic cleavage
of the O–O bond to give ‘‘Compound I’’ (VII), a ferryl species
thought to be the active entity in most P450 oxidations, which
has recently been characterised.6

place exclusively at sub-terminal positions, a speciﬁcity shared
by most bacterial P450s (the CYP153 family being a notable
exception) but not by the CYP4A sub-family of microsomal
fatty acid hydroxylases, which are o-hydroxylators. Pentadecanoic acid was the preferred saturated straight-chain substrate, activity falling away as the chain-length increased or
decreased.16 Fatty amides and alcohols,21 hydroxylated fatty
acids22–24 and o-oxo fatty acids25 were also accepted as substrates, as were unsaturated fatty acids,16,21,26 which could also
be epoxidised.27–29 The product proﬁles given by a selection of
fatty acid substrates are shown in Table 1. With unsaturated fatty acids, the epoxidation/hydroxylation partition was
sensitive to pH28 and also to antibody binding.30 Characterisation of the puriﬁed 119 500 Da31,32 enzyme revealed that
the 55 kDa P450 (or ‘‘haem’’) domain (BMP) was fused to a
65 kDa ‘‘reductase’’ domain (BMR) containing two prosthetic
ﬂavin groups, FAD and FMN, in an equimolar ratio.30,33,34
In addition to catalysing oxidative chemistry, the enzyme
was therefore capable of eﬀecting rapid reduction of artiﬁcial
electron acceptors such as ferricyanide or cytochrome c via
electron transfer from BMR. The CYP102A1 gene was cloned
into E. coli35,36 and sequenced.37
Both domains resembled microsomal enzymes.37 BMR, like
sulphite reductases, shared sequence similarities with mammalian cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR).41,42 BMP aligned well
with eukaryotic P450s such as the CYP2A sub-family and the
CYP4A fatty acid hydroxylases, save for the deletion of a
region at the N-terminus end assumed to code for membrane
binding (typically 25–50 residues).43 For a time it was used as a
template for the sequence analysis of eukaryotic P450s44,45 and
in homology modelling46 as the crystal structure (section 3.1)
became available at a relatively early stage. When compared to
prokaryotic P450s, BMP exhibited minor topological diﬀerences and CO-binding behaviour.47–49 The most conspicuous
contrast was that other bacterial isoforms typically received
electrons from discrete protein partners rather than via an
integrated ﬂavin domain. The unprecedented self-suﬃcient
structure of P450BM3 meant that electron transfer to the haem

NAD(P)H consumption is not necessarily fully coupled to
product formation.7 If dioxygen binding is hindered, the second
electron transfer may be too slow to prevent superoxide being
lost from (IV) (superoxide uncoupling). If (VI) is protonated at
the iron-bound oxygen because a loosely ﬁtting substrate fails to
prevent water encroachment, hydrogen peroxide loss is possible
(peroxide uncoupling). If a substrate binds with no hydrogen
atom conveniently positioned for abstraction, the oxygen ‘‘atom’’
in (VII) may be reduced to water (oxidase uncoupling). High
peroxide concentrations cause the peroxide uncoupling pathway to reverse, a reaction known as the peroxide shunt. This
allows oxidation to be driven using peroxide rather than
NAD(P)H/O2/H+ as in chloroperoxidase (CPO), a related haem
enzyme with axial cysteine coordination, and the CYP152 family.
In hydroxylation reactions, a hydrogen atom is abstracted from
the substrate following the formation of Compound I to give
(VIII), after which ‘‘radical rebound’’ sees OH (including the
abstracted atom) and the substrate radical combine, giving the
impression that oxygen has been inserted into the C–H bond.
The product leaves the active site, returning the enzyme to the
pentacoordinate ferric state (IX). Hydrogen abstraction also
initiates the desaturation pathway, but does not occur in the
epoxidation of unsaturated linkages, including those of aromatic
systems, which are attacked by (VII) directly.5 Mechanistic
deviations from the principal pathway are known. The possible
involvement of cationic intermediates has been probed using
P450BM3.8,9 The enzyme has also been the subject of studies
undertaken to establish whether Compound 0 rather than Compound I is the reactive intermediate in certain oxidations,10–13
and to gain insight into the nature of Compound I.14,15

Discovery and early history of CYP102A1 (P450BM3)

CYP102A1 was discovered in the early seventies by Fulco
et al., who identiﬁed it as a soluble medium- to long-chain
fatty acid hydroxylase that required only NADPH and oxygen
to function.16–19 As the third20 P450 to be isolated from
B. megaterium, the enzyme was designated P450BM3, a name
by which it continues to be widely known. Hydroxylation took

the other widely researched bacterial P450 of the time.67 Synopses
of the early P450BM3 literature exist,20,68–70 but with 20–30 papers
now appearing annually, a ﬁgure that has roughly doubled each
decade since the enzyme’s discovery, a formidable research
archive has built up, and recent reviewers have preferred to
focus on selected topics71–74 or place the enzyme into context
within the wider P450 ﬁeld.75–78

iron was not contingent on the enzyme encountering a redox
partner, either in solution or bound at an adjoining position
on a membrane. Partly for this reason, activity levels were up
to three orders of magnitude higher than in other P450 fatty
acid hydroxylases.50
Other self-supporting P450s have since been identiﬁed, and
these have been reviewed.51 CYP505 (P450foxy), a sub-terminal
fatty acid hydroxylase from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum,
was the ﬁrst to be recognised.52,53 Further examples include
ferredoxin/ﬂavin/P450 fusions from species of Burkholderia
and Ralstonia metallidurans54 and CYP116 family members
such as those found in Rhodococcus sp. (P450RhF)55 and
Rhodococcus ruber DSM 44319.56 Nitric oxide synthase
(NOS), a soluble eukaryotic FAD- and FMN-containing
haemoprotein that oxidises L-arginine to citrulline and nitric
oxide,57 and P450BM3 have remarkably similar architectures.
Interest in P450BM3 began to widen in the early nineties.50,58–61
Alternative expression and puriﬁcation methods were
reported,50,62–66 and it was established that the porphyrin
system could be removed from its binding site and replaced
without impairing activity—a contrast to CYP101A1 (P450cam),

The precise physiological role of the enzyme is obscure. For
many years, the natural substrates were assumed to be straightchain fatty acids, and these have been copiously researched,
with the result that over thirty diﬀerent NADPH consumption
rates (N, kcat or Vmax) have been published for lauric acid (C12),
one of the more soluble exemplars, ranging from 1.4 s1 to 86 s1
(Table 2). However, NADPH utilisation is not fully coupled to
product formation when saturated fatty acids are oxidised
in vitro,30,79,80 as it is in camphor oxidation by P450cam. Moreover,
whereas P450cam expression can be induced in Pseudomonas putida
by camphor, the natural substrate, P450BM3 expression is not
induced in B. megaterium by saturated straight-chain fatty acids81

or monounsaturated acids. Polyunsaturated analogues such as
linoleic and arachidonic acids, by contrast, do induce P450BM3
expression,82,83 binding 1000-fold more strongly to the repressor
protein, Bm3R1.84–89 Given the important homeostatic role in
the arachidonic acid cascade played by eukaryotic P450 monooxygenases,90 it is interesting that P450BM3 appears to be more
active towards arachidonic acid than other straight-chain
analogues.29 However, unsaturated fatty acids are toxic to
B. megaterium if applied exogenously,82 and there is evidence
to suggest that they are synthesised only as a transient response
to cold, and even then in small quantities.91 This raises the
possibility that one function of the enzyme may be to detoxify
the xenobiotic lipids produced by plants. Branched-chain saturated fatty acids, which play a key role in the regulation of
membrane ﬂuidity, also induce P450BM3 expression,92 and it has
been argued39,40 that these are more likely to be the enzyme’s
true substrates, since they account for almost 90% of the fatty
acid content of B. megaterium.93
Barbiturates, though not accepted as substrates by
P450BM3,63,128 are also powerful inducers of the enzyme,81,128
particularly if lipophilic,129 as are certain acetylureas130,131 and
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs such as 17b-estradiol132,133
and ibuprofen.134 Ibuprofen also induces other enzymes associated
with oxidative stress response in Bacillus, including catalase and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).135 However, barbiturate induction is inhibited by certain phytochemicals,136 so it may
be inappropriate to rely too heavily on such studies when seeking
to interpret the function of the enzyme. In separate research, it has
been established that N-acyl amino acids100 and their homoserine and homoserine lactone derivatives101 bind more tightly
to P450BM3 than the corresponding fatty acids, and are also
rapidly oxidised. N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are used
by bacteria to sense and signal population density, become
ca. 20-fold less active when sub-terminally hydroxylated.
Although it is unlikely that P450BM3 regulates density signalling in a physiological context, this ﬁnding has raised the
possibility of the enzyme playing a part in a pathogen resistance system for use in genetically modiﬁed crops.137
1.5

The CYP102A sub-family

Fulco trawled unsuccessfully for P450BM3-like proteins in other
species of Bacillus,138 but showed good instincts in searching
as current microbial genome databases reveal that there are
more than ﬁfty homologues of the CYP102A1 gene distributed
among bacteria (CYP102) and fungi (CYP505). Several of
the corresponding CYP102A sub-family proteins have been
expressed and characterised, including CYP102A2 and A3
from B. subtilis,139–141 A5 from B. cereus142 and A7 from
B. licheniformis,143 all of which were more active than A1
with preferred fatty acid substrates. A14 from an uncultured
soil bacterium was less active than A1 with fatty acids, but
accepted naphthalene and phenanthrene as substrates,144
while A2 was signiﬁcantly more active towards 1,4-naphthoquinone and sodium dodecyl sulphate than lauric acid.145,146
A2 and A3, unlike A1, did not appear to play a physiological
role in fatty acid detoxiﬁcation.147 Publications have recently
begun to appear on other CYP102 sub-family members.148
Biophysical property contrasts were apparent within the
102A sub-family. A3 was less stable than A1 in saline solution,
1222

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

hampering puriﬁcation.139 A7 was less thermostable than
A1,143 and the haem domains of A2 and A3 less stable than
BMP,149 but the A3 reductase domain was more thermostable
than BMR.150 A3139 and A7143 were more tolerant than A1 of
DMSO, a co-solvent commonly employed to enhance substrate
solubility.151 A2 was an ineﬃcient haem incorporator.140,141
Preincubation with a substrate (section 5.2.2) caused no change
to activity in A3,152 but resulted in a 60% activity increase in
A1 and a 40% decrease in A2.141 Electron transfer through the
reductase domain (section 2.2) was signiﬁcantly faster in A5
than in A1 or A2.142 A2 and A3 have been engineered,139,145,152
as have A5 and A7.153 The homologue of a desirable mutation discovered in A3 was subsequently found to be eﬀective
in A1,154 so cross-engineering opportunities exist within the subfamily.

(Fig. 2) shows that the F/G and G/H loops, the ﬁrst half of
the G-helix and the domain extremities (residues 1–32 and
447–473) are poorly conserved. It is probably no coincidence
that these regions are relatively plastic.155 This suggests that
they interact weakly with other regions of the enzyme, potentially permitting a higher incidence of mutation. It is also
worth bearing in mind that mammalian isoforms typically
contain insertions at the N-terminus end and in the F/G
and/or G/H loops relative to the CYP102A sub-family.43
The same is true of the J/J 0 loop, where A6 and A10–A14
show a three-residue insertion relative to the other sub-family
members. Highly conserved regions include the B 0 /C loop
and the C-helix, the E-helix and most of the E/F loop,
much of the I-helix and the b5-sheet that precedes it, and the
proximal loop together with the region to the N-terminus side
(residues 391–402). The six regions identiﬁed as substrate
recognition sites (SRSs) across the P450 superfamily using
sequence alignment techniques156 display a range of conservation levels. SRS4 (residues 253–271) is almost fully conserved,
and there is relatively little variation in SRS6 (434–441). The
C-terminus portion of SRS1 (69–92) is well conserved, but
the N-terminus portion exhibits a number of discontinuities.
Residues 72 and 73 are Glu-Gly or Arg-Gly in all but four
isoforms, for instance, but Gly-Lys in A3 and A7 and Ser-Gln
in A1, while proline is used at residue 74 in the B 0 -helix of A10
and A11 rather than the usual Ala or Gly. SRS2 (181–188)
and SRS5 (325–335) each contain interesting anomalies. The
C-terminus end of SRS5 has the consensus sequence Tyr-GlyX-Ala-Pro in A6 and A10–A14, as against Phe-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Ala
in the remaining isoforms, for instance. SRS3 (200–208), which is
almost entirely unconserved, should probably not be viewed as an
SRS in P450BM3.48
A recent study of a group of naturally occurring CP102A1
variants has provided some useful context for this ﬁeld.157
Divergences of >50-fold in palmitic acid (C16) binding
aﬃnity and >25-fold in lauric acid hydroxylation rates were
recorded, while two of the nine distinguishable strain types
showed slight activity towards phenacetin, a non-natural
substrate. There were also signiﬁcant contrasts in thermostability and in the rates of ferricyanide and cytochrome c
reduction, reﬂecting the fact that the majority of the variable residues were in the reductase domain and the linker
region.

2.1

Domains and the linker region

Once cleaved by tryptic proteolysis, BMP and BMR showed little
aﬃnity for one another, and fatty acid hydroxylase activity could
not be reconstituted.34,50 The same was generally the case when
the domains were expressed and puriﬁed separately,58,61,67,103
though outcomes were impacted by the ratios in which they were
mixed.95 This revealed the importance of the region linking the
two domains.103 Deleting residues from the linker progressively
inactivated the enzyme,79 but mutagenesis resulted in a modest
enhancement to myristic acid hydroxylation rates, particularly
when proline and glycine substitutions were introduced to deter
helix formation.94 Whereas the linker region in NOS binds
calmodulin in a helical conformation,158 there is therefore no
apparent incumbency on the P450BM3 linker to exist as a helix.
The linker varies signiﬁcantly in length across the CYP102A subfamily, being nine residues shorter in A1, A10 and A15 than in
A4, A5, A8 and A9, which have the longest linkers so far
discovered (Fig. 2).
Isolated BMR was less amenable to expression than isolated
BMP,62 less stable,159 and susceptible to temperature-induced
activity loss.160 When proteolysed, it yielded two sub-domains,
an FMN-binding region and an FAD/NADPH-binding
region,59,161 both of which could be expressed as separate
entities.162 As in CPR,163 the FMN-binding portion exhibited
good homology with FMN-containing bacterial ﬂavodoxins,
while the FAD portion resembled the FAD-containing spinach
ferredoxin reductase.164 This suggested that the full-length
protein had evolved via the fusion of at least three separate
sub-entities. Neither the FAD domain nor the FMN domain
was active individually as a cytochrome c reductase,162 but the
FAD domain was 35–80% as active as the full-length enzyme
as a ferricyanide reductase.162,164 The enzyme showed a lower
binding aﬃnity for FMN than for FAD,159,164 again as in
CPR.165 Myristic acid was slowly hydroxylated when BMP was
mixed with NADPH and FMN,166 and slight oxidase activity
(ca. 5%) could be reconstituted with palmitic acid when BMP
was mixed with the separated FMN and FAD domains.167
2.2

Electron transfer70,168,169

The ability of the isoalloxazine rings of the ﬂavins in BMR to
form semiquinones when reduced by one electron is central to
their function, as it allows electrons to be shuttled singly to the
iron centre. Semiquinone formation was not detected when
P450BM3 was reductively titrated with NADPH or dithionite,170
but could be demonstrated using EPR,105 and was readily observed when the isolated FAD161,162 and BMR105,171 domains were
reduced. As in microsomal CPR,165,172 electrons pass from
NADPH to FAD and thence to FMN before being shuttled
to the haem iron. In CPR, the ﬁnal step entails the reoxidation of FMNH2 to the FMNH semiquinone. In P450BM3,
by contrast, electrons are supplied to the haem iron from
the FMNH semiquinone.42,171 The reduction potentials of the
FMN semiquinone/hydroquinone couples in the two enzymes
are accordingly very diﬀerent.173 The discrepancy can be traced
to the absence of a single glycine residue between Tyr536 and
Asn537 in the FMN binding loop.174 The insertion of glycine at
1224

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

this position gave rise to a protein with CPR-like redox
behaviour,175 while deletion of the corresponding glycine in
NOS, which has a redox architecture similar to CPR, caused
electrons to pass to the haem iron from FMNH rather than
from FMNH2.176 In P450BM3, the ﬁrst electron transfer from
FADH2 to FMN results in the simultaneous formation of a red
anionic FMNH semiquinone, the haem-reducing species, and
a neutral FADH semiquinone, which is blue.42,171 A proposal
that the anionic semiquinone might be FADH rather than
FMNH114 lost support when a red semiquinone was produced
in the isolated FMN domain.177 Reduction potentials were
determined for the FMN/FMNH and FMNH/FMNH22
couples to remove any residual uncertainty.178 A signiﬁcant
decrease in palmitic acid hydroxylase activity took place when
chloro- or amino-substituted FMN was employed in place of
the natural co-factor to alter the FMN reduction potential and,
to a lesser extent, in cytochrome c reductase activity.179
That fatty acid oxidation rates were not lowered by the
presence of cytochrome c, suggested that electron transfer
through the BMR domain was not rate-limiting to hydroxylase activity.30,180 Stopped-ﬂow spectrophotometry conﬁrmed
that the rates of ﬂavin reduction and semiquinone formation
on NADPH addition were rapid even at 5 1C,42 and considerably faster at ambient temperature.105 Substrate binding105,113
and dioxygen binding49 were also too fast to be rate-limiting—
indeed, it is the rapidity with which gaseous diatomic ligands
such as dioxygen or CO bind to the haem iron on reduction
that allows kf, the rate of the ﬁrst FMN-to-haem electron
transfer, to be determined. (An acceptable estimate for kf can
be obtained by measuring the rate at which absorbance at
450 nm increases as a result of FeII(CO) complex formation
following NADPH addition to the substrate-bound enzyme in
CO-saturated buﬀer using stopped-ﬂow techniques.) kf is ratedetermining in P450cam providing ferredoxin is in excess, but
with P450BM3 the position is more complicated. kf values
diminished progressively as residues were deleted from the
linker region, prompting a proportionate fall in the catalytic
rate, kcat, but the latter was roughly an order of magnitude
lower than the former.79 This suggested that a catalytic step
inﬂuenced by related factors such as the second FMN-to-haem
electron transfer might be rate-limiting. Electrons passed
signiﬁcantly more rapidly to the haem iron when bound with
myristate than with laurate.105 Again there was correlation
between kf and kcat, and it was concluded that reaction rates
might be inﬂuenced by a range of steps, including both
FMN-to-haem electron transfer rates and also product release.
A more detailed study indicated that kf was largely ratelimiting with laurate, but substantially less inﬂuential with
palmitate, myristate falling between the two extremes.127
FMN-to-haem electron transfer at 18 s1 was observed in a
photolytically-driven CO-saturated substrate-free construct
from which the FAD/NADPH domain had been removed,
rising to 250 s1 in the presence of myristate181—signiﬁcantly
faster than in many other P450 systems.182 Rates were [CO]dependent in the myristate-bound form, indicating that CO
entered the active site while the haem iron was still in the ferric
state. Cytochrome c reductase activity was similarly stimulated
in a [CO]-dependent fashion in the myristate-bound full-length
enzyme, though ferricyanide activity remained unaﬀected,

implicating interaction between the FMN and BMP domains.113
However, electron transfer also exhibited [CO]-dependence when
photoexcited NAD(P)H was used to reduce isolated BMP.183
The kinetic behaviour of this system was biphasic, whether or
not a substrate was bound, suggesting that CO associated with
the enzyme prior to electron transfer. This presented a contrast
with the monophasic kinetics observed in the full-length
protein, where fatty acid binding had a markedly lower impact
on CO binding than in other prokaryotic P450s.49 Geminate
CO rebinding to the ferrous haem iron following photoinduced dissociation showed biphasic kinetics in the substratefree form of the full-length enzyme, but monophasic kinetics in
the fatty acid-bound form.184 Rebinding appeared to be preceded by transient CO docking to the enzyme, as in globins.185
High-pressure stopped-ﬂow studies showed that CO bound
with similar rate constants to dioxygen in P450BM3 (though
not in NOS), suggesting that the use of CO as a dioxygen proxy
for this enzyme is not unreasonable.186
P450BM3 loses fatty acid hydroxylase activity if incubated
with NADPH (or NADH)114 in the absence of substrate.19,28,30
Inter-domain electron transfer is arrested within milliseconds,187
and 70% inactivation takes place within two minutes, irrespective of dilution levels, though ca. 10% activity is retained for at
least ninety minutes.30 However, activity can be fully recovered
via overnight dialysis. Incubation of BMP with NADPH does
not have the same incapacitating eﬀect as incubation of
BMR,42 and the enzyme can be ‘‘rescued’’ by electron acceptors such as cytochrome c,113,188 conﬁrming that the issue is
BMR-related. The incapacitated form of the enzyme is commonly believed to be the ‘‘over-reduced’’ three-electron species,
FADH/FMNH22113,114,171 which, though incapable of reducing
the haem iron, remains able to reduce cytochrome c.188
Fusions between BMR and mammalian P450s (section 4.4) do
not share this susceptibility.189 BMR activity can also be compromised by NADP+ (or NAD+) accumulation, the oxidised
co-factor binding to a regulatory site and hindering the release of
NADPH from the catalytic site.104,190,191 The conformational
changes induced by the binding of NADPH or NADP+ are
nevertheless integral to the eﬃcient transfer of electrons through
BMR.190
The NADPH-reduced enzyme was unable to bind CO in the
absence of substrate, showing that the reduction potential of
the low-spin haem iron was less oxidising than that of BMR.58
In the presence of substrate, the haem iron was reduced prior
to BMR under CO, but under an argon atmosphere the opposite
occurred, suggesting that CO was pulling the thermodynamically
unfavourable FeIII/FeII equilibrium across by altering the apparent
potential of BMP.170 The accuracy of this interpretation was
conﬁrmed when the FMN/FMNH potential was found to be
more oxidising than that of substrate-bound BMP.173 Like the
ﬁrst FMN-to-haem electron transfer rate, the potential varied
according to the fatty acid bound, but it was always >100 mV
more oxidising than that of the substrate-free form, as in other
P450s.182 It seems natural to draw the conclusion that this is
a gating mechanism designed to prevent the futile cycling of
electrons causing auto-degradative damage when no substrate
is bound, but this may be overly simplistic. In the ﬁrst place,
reduction potentials do not, as thermodynamic parameters,
correlate directly with FMN-to-haem electron transfer rates,

since the latter are kinetic in nature and therefore also reﬂect
the reorganisation energies associated with electron transfer,
as described by Marcus theory.192 To illustrate, the equilibrium constants associated with electron transfer through BMR
diﬀered from those calculated from equilibrium redox potentials by as much as two orders of magnitude.190 Secondly,
experimentally determined potentials do not reﬂect the impact
of rapid dioxygen binding to the ferrous haem iron (which,
like CO binding, alters the equilibrium potential), since they
are necessarily measured under anaerobic conditions.178,192
Finally, P450BM3 variants that consume NADPH at o1.5 nmol
(nmol P450)1 s1 in the substrate-free form despite having
ﬁrst electron transfer rates of >200 s1 have recently been
identiﬁed193,194 (section 5.2). A method of estimating the reduction potentials of P450BM3 variants using UV-visible spectroscopy has been reported.195
2.3 Dimerisation
The speciﬁc fatty acid oxidation activity of P450BM3 increased with increasing protein concentration, suggesting to early
researchers that the functional form of the enzyme was a
complex susceptible to dissociation on dilution.19 This impression strengthened when reductive titration with NADPH
implied that electron transfer could be intermolecular.170
Sedimentation velocity experiments indicated the presence of
a mixture of monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers, but
incubation with DTT showed that the dominant aggregated
form was dimeric, with a ‘‘1.45-mer’’ also prominent.196 The
1.45-mer could in principle be a species comprising one fulllength enzyme and one BMP domain formed as the result of
partial proteolysis. Heterodimer constructs of this kind are
known in NOS, which also loses activity when monomeric.197
It was suggested that the activity loss observed when residues
were deleted from the linker region might owe to the fact that
it had become too short to allow a functional dimer to form.79
The isolated FAD and BMR domains were found to dimerise
via disulphide bridging.164 The same applied to BMP, which
required the mutagenesis of two solvent-exposed cysteine
residues to maintain in a monomeric form.198 However, the
full-length protein dimerised via some other mechanism.164,196,199
Monomerisation was not fully reversible, and the monomer/
dimer equilibrium was sensitive to the presence of substrate
and to ionic strength.199 Although dilution was deleterious to
hydroxylation activity and also to cyctochrome c reductase
activity, it had the opposite eﬀect on ferricyanide activity,
presumably because the FAD domain was more accessible in
the monomer.200 Fusions between P450BM3 and mammalian
isoforms (section 4.4) can also exist as dimers, but electron transfer
appears to be intramolecular rather than intermolecular.189
In NOS, electrons pass from the reductase domain in one
sub-unit of the dimer to the haem iron in the other sub-unit.197
A mixture of two P450BM3 mutants, one with an inactivated BMP domain, the other with an FMN-deﬁcient BMR
domain, showed signiﬁcant levels of hydroxylase activity
reconstitution, implying that intermolecular electron transfer
of an analogous nature occurred in P450BM3.200 Experiments
carried out with a three-component system comprising mutants
with inactivated BMP, FMN and FAD domains invited a diﬀerent

conclusion—namely, that electrons passed from the FAD
domain of the ﬁrst molecule to the FMN domain of the
second, and thence to either of the two BMP units in the
dimer, possibly because the linker between the FMN and FAD
domains was too short for intramolecular FAD-to-FMN
electron transfer to be feasible.199 A signiﬁcantly higher KD
value was obtained for the transition in this work: 327 nM vs.
1 nM. This was attributed to full allowance being made for
the slow kinetics of monomerisation on dilution. There is
experimental evidence in support of a proposal that the slow
activity loss that occurs during extended periods of preincubation in dilute solution is due to FMN depletion rather than
monomerisation,187,201 but also evidence that opposes it.199,200
(FMN depletion via dialysis plays a signiﬁcant role in the
activity loss suﬀered by the isolated BMR domain when
incubated at 30 1C for ca. 30 min, but BMR is essentially
stable at 4 1C.)160
2.4

Spectroscopic approaches

Numerous spectroscopic techniques have been used to probe
the full-length protein and its sub-domains. The equilibrium
between the low-spin and high-spin forms of the ferric haem
iron can be monitored using UV/visible spectroscopy, allowing the determination of substrate binding constants (Table 2).
Resonance Raman, NMR, MCD and EPR have shed complementary light on spin equilibria and the conformational
perturbations that result from the binding of substrates and
exogenous ligands, mutagenesis and physical changes.61,202–214
High pressure returned the substrate-bound enzyme to the
low-spin state, for example,215,216 as did high arachidonate
concentrations (6 mM).217 Resonance Raman showed that
water has readier access to the iron centre in BMP than in the
full-length protein, and that the enzyme was not fully highspin in the presence of palmitate.208 According to NMR shift
data at 27 1C, lauric acid docked 7.6 Å from the ferric haem
iron, a distance too great to permit oxidation,110 suggesting
that substrates approached more closely only on haem
reduction.218 Subsequently published crystal structures of
longer-chain fatty acids and their derivatives conveyed a
similar picture (section 3.1). However, UV/visible spectroscopy and solid-state NMR revealed that the substrate-bound
enzyme underwent a high- to low-spin transition when cooled
to the temperatures at which crystal structures are determined.
This suggested that substrates were dynamic and might lie in
closer proximity to the haem iron at physiological temperatures even in the ferric form.219,220 FTIR was used to probe the
formation of the BMP–FMN domain complex.221 EPR,
MCD, Mössbauer and UV/visible spectroscopy have supplied
insights into the reactive iron intermediates formed during the
latter stages of the catalytic cycle,222–224 and also peroxynitrite
inactivation.225 These include the oxy-ferrous form of the
enzyme226 which, though signiﬁcantly more susceptible to
autoxidation than those of P450cam49 and NOS,226 was fully
stable at 55 1C even in the full-length protein.217
2.5

Eﬀectors, competitive binding and allosteric regulation

BMP is sensitive to conformational changes in, or induced by,
the BMR domain, and vice versa.69 The rate of cytochrome c
1226

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

reduction by BMR was stimulated by myristate binding to the
BMP domain, for example.180 Laurate binding was tighter in
the presence of BMR, the dissociation constant for the fulllength protein being 256 mM vs. 909 mM for the isolated BMP
domain.95 Flavin ﬂuorescence levels in the reductase domain
doubled on laurate addition, while laurate binding and CO
binding in the presence of laurate enhanced cytochrome c
reductase activity by 60% and 3- to 4-fold respectively, but did
not stimulate ferricyanide activity, implicating conformational
change in the FMN domain.113 The cytochrome c reductase
activity of the full-length protein was higher than that of
isolated BMR even in the substrate-free form, suggesting that
BMP and cytochrome c do not compete for the same FMN
binding site.188 Because of the complex relationships that exist
between the various domains, it can be diﬃcult to pinpoint the
origins of behavioural changes brought about by mutagenesis
or alterations to experimental conditions.
The ﬁrst FMN-to-haem electron transfer rate has been shown
to be broadly independent of ionic strength.127,188 Catalytic rates,
on the other hand, were almost four-fold higher at 300 mM
potassium phosphate than at 10 mM.127 The remarkable activity
levels of which the enzyme is capable are therefore not reached
under physiological conditions even though inter-domain electron
transfer remains rapid. High ionic strengths also have an adverse
eﬀect. N-palmitoyl glycine (NPG) oxidation was roughly half as
rapid in 1000 mM KCl as in 100 mM KCl, for example.199 In
P450cam, camphor binding tightens in the presence of potassium
ions, and a potassium binding site has been identiﬁed,227,228
but experiments with a variety of buﬀer types showed that
ionic strength rather than potassium-dependency was responsible for the behaviour observed in P450BM3.127 And yet
buﬀer composition can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on FMNto haem electron transfer rates, which were ca. 100% higher in
potassium phosphate than in Tris/HCl for the laurate- and
myristate-bound enzyme, irrespective of ionic strength.127 It is
worth noting in this context that that the oxy-ferrous form of
the enzyme is more stable in Tris/HCl than in phosphate.217
Binding between the isolated BMP and BMR domains,
though weak, tightened as ionic strength increased, as did
binding between BMP and CPR.229 This was indicative of
electrostatic inter-domain repulsion, and potentially explained
the requirement for BMP and BMR to be covalently linked.
The opposite eﬀect was observed for the binding of CYP2B4
to CPR or BMR. Unlike the unmodiﬁed enzyme, P450BM3
fusion proteins (section 4.4) accordingly exhibited ionic strengthdependent electron transfer behaviour. Electron transfer rates
doubled in a ﬂavodoxin/BMP construct as KCl concentrations
were raised from 50 mM to 250 mM, for instance, underpinned
by a signiﬁcant tightening in binding between the two proteins,
but then decreased on a further increase to 400 mM.230,231 It was
postulated that constructive reorganisation of the electrostatic
complex accounted for the initial response, but that dissociation
took place when ionic strength became excessive, as observed
with other redox partner systems.231 The N-demethylation of
erythromycin by three separate fusions also displayed ionic
strength-dependence across the 0–500 mM NaCl concentration
range, peaking at 500 mM.189
Kinetic titrations with palmitic acid became sigmoidal as ionic
strength was reduced, the point at which Michaelis–Menten

kinetics ceased to apply being higher in Tris/HCl (50 mM) than
in phosphate (25 mM).127 This eﬀect appeared to originate in the
BMP domain, since ionic strength-sensitive behaviour with a
similar transition point was also apparent in binding titrations.
At low phosphate concentrations, a minimum of four palmitate
binding sites was indicated, the fourth binding event being strong
(KD r 2 mM) and cooperative, but the third weak, and both the
second and third inhibitory. At higher phosphate concentrations,
the data ﬁtted a two binding-site model and no longer displayed
cooperativity. Whether phosphate and palmitate competed for
the same binding site was unclear. While it is possible for two
fatty acid molecules to co-occupy the active site (vide infra), it
seems unlikely that as many as four could be accommodated.
Two palmitate molecules are seen to be complexed at the dimer
interface in the crystal structure of human CYP2C8.232 Such a
binding event could in principle explain the P450BM3 data if it
caused conformational changes that led to the displacement of
the axial water ligand. However, it is unclear why palmitate
would bring this about, but not myristate or laurate. Moreover,
four-site binding was observed in the full-length protein as well
as in the isolated BMP domain. Non-hyperbolic behaviour
has also been observed in titrations of fatty acids and related
substrates with CYP102A2 and, to a lesser extent, A3,140,141,146
while CYP102A5 showed sigmoidal kinetics in the oxidation of
linoleic acid.142 Saturated fatty acids incorporating a single
methyl branch were particularly susceptible.
Spectroscopic evidence of various types suggests that fatty
acid substrates can co-occupy the active site with tightly binding
inhibitors such as pyridine,110 metyrapone204 and o-imidazolyl
fatty acids,233 as well as their derivatives.234 Binding of the latter
tightened in the presence of laurate but weakened in the
presence of arachidonate, suggesting that, although the majority
of the funnel-shaped access channel was suﬃciently spacious to
allow co-occupation, there was competition between the inhibitor and the longer-chain substrate at the haem end. Binding
titrations with the inhibitor alone showed non-hyperbolic behaviour only when a space-creating mutation was introduced close
to the haem iron, reinforcing this impression.233,234 Palmitic acid
hydroxylation rates more than doubled when an equal quantity
of lauric acid was added to incubations, and the accompanying
changes to product distributions suggested that the two substrates could occupy the active site simultaneously.122
Co-occupation of the active site may explain the homotropic
cooperativity observed in the metabolism of testosterone by an
engineered P450BM3 variant, though conformational change
induced by binding at an external site would also be consistent
with these data.235 Heterotropic cooperativity was encountered
in the metabolism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine
(MDMA) and acetaminophen by the same variant, activity
being stimulated up to 70-fold by caﬀeine, which could bind to
an allosteric site. Both forms of cooperativity are known in the
CYP3A sub-family, and caﬀeine is an activator of rat CYP3A2.
Interestingly, while caﬀeine stimulates certain P450BM3 variants,
it acts as an inhibitor with others.236 The researchers who carried
out this work noted that deploying a co-ligand could be a viable
means of enhancing oxidase activity and/or altering product
distributions, to be used instead of (or in conjunction with)
mutagenesis.235 Non-hyperbolic kinetics have been observed in
the oxidation of cyclohexane237 and, under alkaline conditions,

indole238—though, with indole, a single active-site mutation was
suﬃcient to bring about a reversion to Michaelis–Menten
kinetics. The binding of trichloroethane,120 indole112 and styrene239
exhibited non-hyperbolic behaviour. Heterotropic cooperativity
was observed in cumene hydroperoxide-driven indole oxidation
(section 7.3), NADPH consumption rates being enhanced by the
presence of cumene hydroperoxide as indole binding tightened,
but neither t-butyl hydroperoxide nor hydrogen peroxide brought
about comparable eﬀects.238 Cyanide binding was cooperative in
two glutamate mutants.193
BMR is also sensitive to ambient conditions. NADPH binding was twofold less rapid in 50 mM phosphate than in 50 mM
MOPS, possibly because the higher ionic strength of the
former (130 mM) was not conducive to charge-transfer complex
formation.188 However, onward electron transfer to FMN was
more rapid at high ionic strength. The rate of ferricyanide reduction by the FAD/NADPH domain varied with ionic strength,
being 90% slower at 1 mM phosphate than at 50 mM.164
Cytochrome c reductase activity also varied with ionic strength,
but in a more complex fashion, peaking at phosphate concentrations of ca. 25 mM.188 Cytochrome b5 reductase activity was
diﬀerent again, being almost 20-fold higher in 500 mM KCl than
in 100 mM KCl, whereas cytochrome c reductase activity was
75% lower.240

Structure

3.1 Crystal structures
The asymmetric unit in the P21 structure of the ﬁrst BMP
crystal structure to be published (Protein Data Bank (PDB)
code 2HPD)241,242 contained a closely associated pair of
molecules, one in a more ‘‘open’’ conformation than the other.
The F/G loop and the F- and G-helices aligned poorly when
the two molecules were overlaid, the B factor for this region
being 80 Å2 vs. 25 Å2 for the structure as a whole. This
suggested the loop was ﬂexible, a property subsequently found
to be common to other P450 structures.48 In contrast to the
only previously published P450 structure—that of P450cam,227
which failed to reveal how substrates reached the haem
iron—the P450BM3 structure showed a long, hydrophobic,
largely non-aromatic substrate access channel. A structure
determined independently to the same resolution (2.0-Å,
PDB code 2BMH)243 overlaid closely onto 2HPD if the F/G
loop was excluded from the comparison, the root mean square
deviation (rmsd) for the backbone Ca atoms being 0.23 Å.
Here, however, both molecules in the asymmetric unit were in
the open conformation, partly on account of intermolecular
crystal packing constraints. Energy minimisation calculations
showed that the open conformation was too spacious to bind
myristic acid eﬀectively, but suggested that the access channel
would reshape in response to substrate binding, producing a
closed conformation in which protein-substrate interactions
would be enhanced. Structures at resolutions of 1.65-Å (1BU7)174
and 1.2-Å (2IJ2)244 followed. The latter is one of several in which
the porphyrin unit is found to incorporate in either of two
conformations related by a 1801 rotation,126,194 a phenomenon
that also occurs in other P450 structures.245
The ﬁrst structure to be solved with a substrate in situ, that
of palmitoleiate-bound BMP (1FAG),155,246 contained four

Fig. 3 Substrate-induced structural changes in P450BM3. The substrate-free BMP structure (PDB code 1BU7)174 is in grey, with waters and
hydrogen bonds in black, and the haem iron in orange. The NPG-bound structure (PDB code 1JPZ)201 is in green, including waters and hydrogen
bonds, with the haem iron in brown, and NPG in salmon. (A) Complete overlay, showing the movements of the F-, G- and H-helices and the F/G
and G/H loops on substrate binding, and the disruption to the turn pattern of the I-helix. In regions that show little or no change on substrate
binding the NPG structure is in yellow. The Table of Contents entry shows a complementary representation of this movement. (B) Regions of the
G-, H- and I-helices, showing (i) scission of the Lys224–Asp251 salt bridge and extension of the Asp217–Arg255 salt bridge, which together
reshape the I-helix, causing the turn pattern to translocate; (ii) scission of the Gln229–Asn239 salt bridge, either caused by, or as a response to,
increased ﬂexibility in the G/H loop (a region not fully resolved in molecule A of the NPG structure), which may contribute to the destabilisation
of the Lys224–Asp251 salt bridge. (C) The kink region of the I-helix, where hydrogen-bonding networks are extensively redistributed, primarily as
a result of the repositioning of Gly265, the rotation of His266, and the loss of Wat202. The rotation of the Phe261 side-chain is a response to
movements at Ile 219 and Phe158.194 (D) The active site, showing (i) the sinking of the proximal loop where the proximal cysteine ligand, Cys400 is
situated, which causes the haem iron to lie below the porphyrin plane; (ii) displacement of the axial water ligand (Wat23), which remains hydrogenbonded to Ala264, to the ‘‘alternative’’ binding site (Wat502) as the I-helix recedes; (iii) loss of Wat202, which allows the I-helix kink angle to
contract from 131 to 51; (iv) rotation at Phe87 and the associated retreat of the Leu437 side-chain.

molecules in the asymmetric unit. The most conspicuous
diﬀerence between the substrate-bound (SB) and substratefree (SF) forms was the positioning of the F- and G-helices and
the F/G loop (Fig. 3A). Both helices tilted and were translated
along their axes by approximately half a turn, closing the access
channel and disrupting contacts with the I-helix, including a
salt bridge (Fig. 3B). Electron density was clearer in this region
of the structure than in the SF form, showing that the loop was
less disordered. The most widely cited SB structure is that of the
complex formed with NPG (1JPZ),201 a substrate that is more
soluble than fatty acids of equivalent chain length and also
binds an order of magnitude more tightly. Water molecules
were clearly resolved in this structure. Only three remained in

the active site and access channel, as compared to 17–21 in
SF structures. Amongst those no longer present was Wat202
(Fig. 3C) which had interrupted the I-helix in the SF form,
creating the kink or groove where dioxygen binding is believed
to take place by preventing the formation of a hydrogen bond.
With Wat202 absent, a normal intrahelical hydrogen bond was
formed, reducing the I-helix kink angle from 131 to 51. In
addition, the turn pattern of the helix was translated, with the
result that that the associated network of hydrogen bonds
was extensively rearranged (Fig. 3C). The water molecule
closest to the haem iron was displaced to an oﬀ-axial position
by the movement of the I-helix, to which it remained hydrogenbonded, leaving the iron centre pentacoordinate. It was proposed

that the spin state equilibrium of the ferric haem iron arose from
partitioning of this water molecule between the ‘‘alternative’’
binding site (Wat502, Fig. 3D) and the iron-bound axial site
(Wat23). The N-palmitoyl methionine-bound structure (1ZO9)100
was broadly similar to the NPG-bound structure. The structure of
the enzyme has been compared to, and contrasted with, those of
other P450 structures.169
An artiﬁcial construct of BMP complexed with the proteolysed FMN domain has been crystallised (1BVY).174 The
asymmetric unit contained a pair of tightly associated BMP
units, as in the majority of P450BM3 structures, and a single
FMN domain docked on the proximal side of one of the iron
centres, disrupting the Pro382–Gln387 region. Given that the
Asn381–Ala389 insertion characteristic of eukaryotic P450s is
not found in other bacterial P450 families, it was suggested
that these residues might be critical to inter-domain binding. The crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH domain has
been solved.71 A structure of BMP bound with the inhibitor
N-(12-imidazolyldodecanoyl) L-leucine (3BEN)234 overlaid
poorly with other SB structures but closely with the SF
structure. This disparity is the antithesis of that displayed by
the SF structures of certain variants that are more active as
oxidases than the wild-type enzyme (WT), which resemble SB
forms of WT more closely than SF WT (section 5.1). Structures have also been determined for two DMSO-permeated
forms of BMP with the object of establishing why high
concentrations of this co-solvent inactivate the enzyme.247
Crystals were grown at 14% v/v and 28% v/v DMSO (LD
and HD, PDB codes 2J4S and 2J1M respectively). In LD, the
nearest water molecule to the haem iron lay at a Fe–O distance
of 3.75 Å vs. 2.6 Å in SF WT and was oﬀ-axial as in SB
WT—yet the iron atom, which moves to the proximal side of
the porphyrin system in SB WT (Fig. 3D), lay 0.16 Å to the
distal side. In HD, DMSO became a sixth ligand, coordinating
to the haem iron through the sulphur atom rather than the
oxygen. This reconciled with spectroscopic analysis, which
showed the enzyme to be partially high-spin at 14% (v/v)
DMSO, but fully low-spin at higher DMSO concentrations.
3.2

Key residues

Like certain mammalian P450s,248 P450BM3 crystallises in a
‘‘precatalytic’’ conformation in which no substrate atom lies
suﬃciently close to the haem iron for oxidation to take place. It
is thus unclear whether the conformations in which the residues
lining the access channel are depicted are catalytically relevant,
complicating the task of engineering the enzyme. Most have
nonetheless been subjected to site-speciﬁc mutagenesis with a
view to clarifying the roles that they play in the catalytic
process—typically via comparison of the fatty acid oxidation
rates and product distributions given by the mutants generated
with those of the wild-type enzyme. The substrate access
channel portion of the NPG-bound structure is shown in Fig. 4.
3.2.1. Arg47 and Tyr51. Fulco’s prognosis that a hydrophilic binding region must tether the carboxylate groups of
fatty acid substrates many Ångströms from the haem iron21

channel, Arg47 and Tyr51155 (Fig. 4A), potentially explaining
the dependence of product partitioning on pH.28 The R47E
mutant was inactive towards arachidonic acid98 but retained
some activity towards shorter-chain fatty acids, and eﬃciently
hydroxylated C12–C16 trimethylammonium compounds, the
polarity reversal enabling the enzyme to accept a substrate of
the opposite ionic character.31 Mutagenesis of either residue
generally lowered fatty acid hydroxylase activity and raised
binding constants, suggesting that they acted jointly as gatekeepers to the active site.99,106 Together, the two residues may
regulate not only the admission of substrates, but also water249
and co-solvents.151 That the R47A/Y51F double substitution
reduced catalytic eﬃciency by two thirds even with a shortchain substrate such as hexanoate suggested that, in addition
to functioning as a binding site, the couplet was responsible for
luring substrates to the access channel opening.250 Arg47,
which lies at the enzyme surface and is unusually variable in its
position in crystal structures (and sometimes ill-deﬁned),155,246
seems likely to be more inﬂuential in this role than Tyr51. Arg47
does not form a hydrogen bond with the substrate in the NPGbound201 or N-palmitoyl methionine-bound100 crystal structures.
Possibly fatty acid substrates tether instead to Tyr51 and Ser72
when binding closer to the haem iron, as suggested by recent
modelling studies on perﬂuorocaprate.251 However, position 47 is
undoubtedly important for the binding of N-acyl homoserines
and their lactone derivatives in solution, since the R47S mutant

enhanced the aﬃnity of the enzyme for the latter relative to the
former by almost 250-fold.137
Although the tyrosine residue is conserved in microsomal
fatty acid o-hydroxylases, the arginine residue is not,69 and
neither residue is conserved in P450foxy, which otherwise has the
same key active-site residues as P450BM3 (Phe42 excepted).53
P450foxy is inactivated by myristic acid and longer-chain analogues but metabolises fatty acid esters such as monopalmitoyl
glycerol,53,252 suggesting that the primary function of the Arg47/
Tyr51duet in P450BM3 may be to control substrate speciﬁcity.
Strikingly, P450BM3 is the only CYP102A sub-family member
with a polar residue at position 51 or its equivalent, and also the
only one with a positively charged residue at position 47 (Fig. 2).
This has obliged researchers to re-examine some long-standing
assumptions. Although fatty acid binding is tighter in A1 than in
A2, A3 or A5,140,142 hydroxylase activity levels with unsaturated
fatty acids are lower in A1 than in A2 and A3.143 Does this
indicate that over-tight binding is counter-productive? And how
is it that activity levels in A2, A3 and A7 are broadly similar to
those in A1 with saturated fatty acids irrespective of chain-length,
even though they lack the Arg/Tyr couplet?143 A likely explanation is that other sub-family members incorporate substrate
tethers at diﬀerent locations. Positions 352A1141 and 435A1149
have been suggested as possible binding sites in A2, for example,
where Arg and Gln are employed respectively. Position 72A1
(vide supra), where most sub-family members use arginine or
glutamate, is another contender, given that the S72Y mutant
brought about a substantial selectivity shift in lauric acid
hydroxylation relative to WT in A1.119 A deeper-set binding
site would also be consistent with the capacity of A3 to
hydroxylate fatty acids at the (o-8) position.143
3.2.2. Phe87. The side-chain of Phe87 extends into the
lumen of the substrate access channel, close to the haem iron.
In the SF crystal structure, it lies roughly perpendicular to the
porphyrin system, but in SB crystal structures it is rotated
through ca. 901 and occupies a position between the iron
centre and the substrate tail155 (Fig. 3D and 4B). It has been
proposed that this motion, as distinct from substrate binding,
is responsible for displacing the axial water ligand from its
coordination site, since it reduces the distance of closest
approach to just 3.1 Å.201 It may also trigger other aspects
of active site reorganisation.253 Early researchers hypothesised
that Phe87 might be responsible for the sub-terminal oxidation
speciﬁcity shown by P450BM3, since microsomal fatty acid
o-hydroxylases typically employ leucine in the homologous
position.69 The idea was strongly supported by a report that
mutant F87A gave >90% o-hydroxylation with lauric and
myristic acids.111 A popular rationalisation was that the
termini of fatty acid substrates were sequestered,21 a process
in which the phenylalanine side-chain played a role.26,155,242
However, primary alcohol formation could seldom be reproduced
in subsequent studies.71,99,119,123,125,253 It has been suggested that
faulty derivatisation protocols could be to blame,122,254 but
this seems unlikely, given the number of diﬀerent investigations
involved. Interestingly, small quantities of o-hydroxylation
(ca. 3.5%) were reported with lauric acid as recently as 2008
by researchers who not only agreed with the consensus that
mutation F87A shifts the focus of attack towards the centre of
1230

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

the substrate relative to WT rather than towards the terminus,
but also observed no o-hydroxylation in turnovers with palmitic
acid or farnesol, which has the same chain length as lauric acid.32
It is now accepted that the sub-terminal hydroxylation
speciﬁcity generally displayed by P450BM3—with or without
the F87A mutation present—owes to the fact that most substrates are suﬃciently dynamic, even when bound, to allow the
enzyme to discriminate between closely situated C–H bonds
on the basis of reactivity (sections 3.3, 5.3). But it is also
the case that Phe87 possesses powerful speciﬁcity-inﬂuencing
and activity-regulating properties. With arachidonic acid, the
F87V mutant gave 100% 14(S)-15(R)-epoxidation vs. 20% for
WT, which also gave ca. 80% 18(R)-hydroxylation98 (Table 1).
The same mutation caused a sharp increase in peroxide
uncoupling relative to WT with lauric acid.99 The F87Y mutant
was fully uncoupled in turnovers with arachidonic acid,98 but
gave signiﬁcantly higher kcat/KM values than WT and a selection of other single-site mutants during the early stages of lauric
acid oxidation.106 However, the F87Y and F87G mutants both
exhibited ﬁrst FMN-to-haem electron transfer rates that were
80–90% lower in the laurate-bound form than that shown by
WT.106 Phe87 is the most commonly mutated residue in the
protein. Residues with less bulky side-chains than the naturally
occurring phenylalanine are typically introduced, creating incremental space in the vicinity of the haem iron and elevating the
active-site water population. Although this can increase peroxide
uncoupling levels with small, loosely-ﬁtting non-natural substrates, it is often beneﬁcial to the oxidation of larger substrates
as well as those with hydrophilic character. The F87V mutation
is thus a common component of drug-metabolising variants
(section 6.1), while the F87A mutant is often deployed when
dealkylation is the objective.
3.2.3. Glu267 and Thr268. The P450 superfamily has a
highly conserved acid-alcohol pairing close to the kink region
of the I-helix—typically Asp-Thr or Glu-Thr. In P450BM3, the
residues in question are Glu267 and Thr268 (Fig. 3C and 4D).
Thr268, one of the few polar features of the active site, has
been implicated in various roles including proton delivery,
dioxygen activation, and the stabilisation of the oxy-ferrous or
hydroperoxy catalytic intermediate (IV and VI, Fig. 1).10,11,107
The T268A mutation caused NADPH consumption rates and
coupling levels to collapse in the oxidation of lauric,255
palmitic96,255 and arachidonic96 acids, implying that the
threonine side-chain might position a critical active-site water
molecule in WT.96 This interpretation was supported by the
subsequently published NPG-bound crystal structure, which
showed the side-chain OH group of Thr268 stabilising the
‘‘alternative’’ binding site for the water molecule closest to the
haem iron201 (Fig. 3C and D). With pentadecanoic acid,
however, coupling was unaltered at ca. 90%, indicating that
the conserved threonine was not in fact essential for eﬃcient
catalysis.80 Since the mutant converted 68% of the reducing
equivalents to peroxide in palmitic acid turnovers, as against
1% for WT, it was postulated that uncoupling was a function
of substrate chain-length-driven variations in the active-site
water population, on which the positioning of individual water
molecules would be expected to depend. The ﬁrst FMN-tohaem electron transfer rate was found to be Z 70% lower in
This journal is

the arachidonate-bound form of T268A than in WT,107 consistent with the 80% reduction in the NADPH consumption
rate observed in the oxidation of palmitic acid.80 However, the
myristic acid rate was 30% higher with T268A than with WT,
mirroring the uncoupling trends.80
The E267Q mutant also had an adverse impact on fatty
acid oxidation activity, proving just 5% as active as WT with
palmitic acid, and raising uncoupling levels in lauric acid
oxidation.116 The Glu267 side-chain is typically hydrogenbonded to at least one water molecule in SF crystal structures,
and it was suggested that even a relatively conservative substitution such as Gln for Glu could be suﬃcient to disrupt proton
delivery pathways. With this mutation, however, uncoupling
came largely via the oxidase pathway rather than through
peroxide formation, and (o-1)-hydroxylation levels halved
from ca. 45% in myristic acid oxidation while (o-3)-hydroxylation levels doubled to ca. 55%. This suggests that compromised
substrate positioning made at least some contribution to the
activity loss. The E267V mutation, by contrast, enhanced
coupling eﬃciency relative to WT with certain substrates.256
Whereas the E267Q mutant was fully low-spin in the SF
form,255 E267V-containing variants were partially high-spin.
Computer simulations (section 3.3) suggested that the activesite water content was relatively low when this mutation
was present,256 inﬂuenced presumably by the removal of the
glutamate side-chain. This could impact the partition between
the binding sites available to the water molecule closest to the
haem iron, potentially explaining the mixed spin state, and
would also be expected to mitigate peroxide uncoupling levels
if carried through to the SB form.
3.2.4. Other residues. The carbonyl oxygen of Ala264,
which is part of the I-helix, is hydrogen-bonded to the water
molecule closest to the haem iron in almost all the crystal
structures published to date, irrespective of whether or not a
substrate is bound and whether the water molecule is axially
coordinated or at the ‘‘alternative’’ site. It therefore appears to
be instrumental in drawing the water ligand away from the
axial binding site when the I-helix retreats from the haem iron
on substrate binding201 (Fig. 3D).
It has been suggested that access channel residue Leu437
acts as a ‘‘safety catch’’ for Phe87, preventing rotation of the
side-chain to the SB position when no substrate is bound112
(Fig. 3D). While there is good evidence to suggest that the two
residues move in tandem,194 the distance of closest approach is
4.7 Å, which appears too high for steric interaction to be
directly responsible.
Another proposal is that Phe42 caps the access channel once
a substrate has entered and bound,242 supporting evidence
coming from a study showing that catalytic eﬃciency with
lauric acid was 15-fold lower in the F42A mutant than in
WT, and the ﬁrst FMN-to-haem electron transfer Z 90%
slower.106 However, the position of the phenylalanine sidechain does not alter signiﬁcantly on substrate binding according to the crystal structure, and although this residue is
conserved in CYP102A3, A7 and A15 it is not present across
the remainder of the sub-family or in P450foxy.
Phe393, which lies to the proximal side of the porphyrin
system, may tune the rate of haem reduction to optimise the

oxygen binding rate.213,257,258 This residue is highly conserved
across the P450 superfamily, and most of the isoforms that do
not employ it catalyse isomerisation or rearrangement, processes
for which dioxygen activation is not required259 (CYP101C1
being a notable exception). The role played by Trp96 (originally
reported as Trp97), another conserved residue, is more obscure.102
Two reductase domain residues worthy of note are Gly570,
which is important for FMN binding,260 and Trp1046 which
shields the prosthetic FAD group and controls co-factor
speciﬁcity.200
3.3 Computational methods
Computational techniques are routinely used to rationalise
experimental ﬁndings or prepare the ground for new research,
most commonly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on
crystal structure data. In an early example, it was conﬁrmed that
the enzyme structure was dynamic and could adopt open or
closed conformations.261 Docking studies suggested that substrate capture should bring about a transition to the closed
conformation, after which the F/G helix domain would rotate.262
Random expulsion simulations suggested that the products from
fatty acid oxidation left the active site via an opening close to the
point of entry, with scission of the Arg47/Tyr51 tether being the
ﬁnal step in the catalytic process.263,264 Because non-natural
substrates cannot tether in the same fashion, it is unclear how
the products from non-natural substrate oxidation are expelled.
The existence of a possible exit route on the proximal side of the
haem iron has been mooted.256 In CYP2C5, products seem
likely to depart through a solvent channel that reaches the
protein surface between the F-, E- and I-helices and the b4
sheet.265 This channel (which is not to be confused with the
water channel on the proximal side of the haem)266 closes in
substrate-bound crystal structures of wild-type P450BM3,201 and
may also be partially closed in the substrate-free forms of
certain variants with low active-site water contents according
to computer simulations.256 However, there is as yet no evidence
to suggest that it doubles as an exit channel in P450BM3.
Computational solvent mapping implied that the active sites
of mammalian P450s could reshape to accommodate substrates of diﬀerent shapes and sizes more readily than that of
P450BM3.267 Modelling studies suggested that the P450BM3
active site was less cramped than that of human CYP4A11,
a terminal fatty acid hydroxylase, giving the tails of substrates
such as lauric acid room to pass the haem iron.268 This tallied
with the enzyme’s trademark reluctance to eﬀect terminal
hydroxylation. A combination of computational techniques was
used to show that substrate-protein interactions could promote
o-hydroxylation by modulating intrinsic bond reactivities.269
Lauric acid appeared less susceptible to o-hydroxylation than
octane unless the charge at the carboxylate group was neutralised. Replica exchange MD simulations suggested that the
termini of substrates such as NPG approached the ferric haem
iron more closely at higher temperatures,270,271 corroborating
NMR evidence to the same eﬀect predicated on the temperature sensitivity of spin shift equilibria.219 Corroboration was
important because other spectroscopic evidence and mutant
crystal structures were increasingly indicating that displacement of the axial water ligand to the haem iron and the related
conformational change were not necessarily substrate-induced,

meaning that changes to the spin equilibrium might or might
not be substrate-driven.71,112,125,194 At least three distinct
substrate conformations existed in a dynamic equilibrium,
undermining the idea that the termini of fatty acid substrates
were rigidly sequestered by the protein.
MD simulations indicated that the E/F loop and the E- and
F-helices were liable to be disrupted by high concentrations
of DMSO,151 by which the enzyme is inactivated, a process in
which the linker region and BMR probably also play important
roles.272 Simulations on the F87A mutant suggested that its
anomalously low DMSO tolerance could stem from the axial
water molecule being more susceptible to displacement than in the
wild-type enzyme.273 MD simulations have also been employed to
assist in the design of chimeric proteins149 (section 4.4), to identify
appropriate mutation sites,274 and to account for product
distributions.275 One study suggested that a conformational
change to one of the haem propionate groups could be responsible
for the distinctive product proﬁles given by a drug-metabolising
mutant, a possibility consistent with resonance Raman data.256

Objectives

There is widespread interest in developing P450 variants suitable for biocatalysis,282,283 a technique that has already been
successfully applied to ketone reduction, Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, enantioselective transesteriﬁcation, and epoxide opening.284
Chemical C–H bond oxidation methods typically require harsh
conditions, produce undesirable side-products and give racemic
outcomes, often in low yields. Lucrative synthetic opportunities
therefore await any new technology that can oﬀer environmentally friendly regio- and stereo-speciﬁc hydroxylation and/or
epoxidation routes.285 Eukaryotic P450s oxidise an impressive
range of substrates and are already used to produce hydrocortisone, but these can be challenging to isolate and are slowacting. Much of the research in this area has therefore focused on
the soluble and more tractable bacterial isoforms, and particularly on P450BM3, with its self-suﬃcient electron transport
system. A few of the enzyme’s natural substrates are precursors
to desirable oxidation products: linoleic acid is metabolised to
leukotoxin, whose derivatives are implicated in a variety of
pathophysiological responses;286 certain linolenic acid derivatives may possess antifungal properties;287 and it is possible
to produce precursors to d- and g-lactones, which ﬁnd applications as fragrance components and antibiotics, from fatty acid
substrates.119 But the majority of the products that are of interest
to researchers have precursors that are not natural substrates for
the wild-type enzyme. By and large, these do not ﬁt the active site
well and are unable to saturate it, meaning oxidation takes place
slowly, if at all. Substrate speciﬁcity can be radically altered via
mutagenesis, however, leading to signiﬁcant activity enhancement, and this is a primary engineering aim. As with any catalyst,
robustness and longevity are also important considerations, and
stability management constitutes a secondary engineering goal.
Selectivity control is also critical, given that most organic
substrates contain a variety of possible oxidation sites. Ceteris
paribus, oxidation should take place at the most highly activated
carbon centre, but in practice P450 product proﬁles are generally
1232

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

inﬂuenced to a greater or lesser extent by protein-substrate interactions. P450cam oxidises camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor with
100% regioselectivity and 100% stereoselectivity,288 for example,
demonstrating the exquisite speciﬁcity of which these enzymes are
capable. Although P450BM3 occasionally delivers high levels of
regio- and/or stereo-selectivity38,97,98,289,290 (Table 1), the active site
is more spacious than that of P450cam, allowing greater substrate
mobility, and mixtures of oxidation products are more typical.
For a speciﬁc product to be formed in high percentages,
the substrate from which it originates must be constrained to
bind in a particular orientation. This will normally require
active site redesign—the introduction of a polar residue or the
removal of a bulky side-chain, for example. Selectivity control
is a more demanding challenge than activity enhancement,
partly because the number of residues that contact the substrate is relatively small, and partly because individual mutations do not have predictable or generic eﬀects, meaning that
substrates must generally be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
Directed evolution,291–293 in which mutations are introduced
at random positions using error-prone PCR, is a valuable
complementary tool to site-directed mutagenesis. This approach
has the advantage of being able to generate desirable mutations at residues that do not appear at ﬁrst sight to be of
any obvious importance. The beneﬁts of the two strategies
can be combined using rational evolution, in which selected
residues are subjected to random or semi-random mutagenesis.
Alternatively, directed evolution can be used to identify sites
suitable for targeting, followed by site-saturation mutagenesis
to establish which mutations are most eﬀective in those positions. A streamlined method for site-saturating P450BM3 and
other enzymes has been developed.294 An increasingly favoured
approach is to use directed-evolution variants with enhanced
activity and/or stability proﬁles as a development platform, and
incorporate site-speciﬁc mutations (sometimes chosen on the
basis of site-saturation studies) on a substrate-by-substrate basis
to bias selectivity in the intended fashion. Directed-evolution
variants that display enhanced activity can also be combined
with activity-enhancing site-speciﬁc mutations to obtain incremental activity enhancement, but this methodology is not always
reliable.295 Table 3 catalogues the mutations reported in P450BM3
as of June 2011, the overriding majority of which are in the BMP
domain.
4.2 Site-directed mutagenesis
The earliest reports of non-natural substrate oxidation using
engineered variants involved mutations at Ala328, Thr268 and
Phe87 and substrates that included 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane329
and 2-phenylpropanal.341 Intractable polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were targeted by introducing two space-creating
mutations close to the haem iron, F87A and A264G, and
by neutralising the polar binding site at the mouth of the
access channel using the R47L/Y51F double substitution.249
This resulted in product formation rate (PFR) enhancements
of more than two orders of magnitude. The impact of the
hydrophobic R47L/Y51F couplet appears to be generic, and it
is now widely employed to expedite the oxidation of apolar
substrates.126,295,302–304 Substrate recognition improves, and
water may also be deterred from entering the active site.249

Mutations F87G and F87V raised activity with propylbenzene
and 3-chlorostyrene relative to WT.334 F87A, by contrast,
lowered activity but was more eﬀective in a selectivity-altering
capacity, giving 54% b-hydroxylation with propylbenzene where
WT gave 99% a-hydroxylation and o1% b-hydroxylation.
Alterations to optical purity levels were also observed. Even
the wild-type enzyme gave an NADPH consumption rate of
13 nmol (nmol-P450)1 s1 (henceforth abbreviated to s1)
with propylbenzene—40% higher than that observed with lauric
acid.118
Like fatty acids, n-alkanes are oxidised at sub-terminal positions
by P450BM3. Researchers have sought to create variants with the
ability to convert such substrates instead to primary alcohols,
which are high-value products and synthetic intermediates.
Mutation A328V ﬁgured prominently in a variant that gave
82% 2-octanol and 5% 1-octanol from octane326 where WT
1234

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

gave 17%, and zero respectively, preferring to oxidise the
3- and 4-positions.124 A82L played a lesser role in the selectivity shift, but enhanced coupling levels and doubled the total
turnover number (TTN).326 The F87V/A328F double mutant
gave 92% 2-octanol.339 A328L was the crucial mutation in a
variant that gave 52% 1-octanol from octane, with V78T and
A82G in SRS1 also making signiﬁcant contributions.322 The
oxidation of valencene to nootkatone, a prized grapefruit
ﬂavouring not formed by WT, was accomplished by creating
space in the active site using mutations F87A and I263A.300 The
F87V mutant was found to oxidise phenols, a compound type
accepted only reluctantly by WT.345 Hydroxylation typically
took place para to the phenolic group at PFRs between two and
three orders of magnitude higher than those given by WT. The
F87V mutation has also been used in an activity-enhancing capacity with b-ionone295 and monoterpenes.302 Mutations A82F,

F87V, I263A and A328V were used to raise epoxidation levels
at the expense of allylic hydroxylation with terminal alkenes.321
F87L has been employed in a selectivity-directing capacity
with octane322 and n-butylbenzene.194 The F87L mutation
also proved useful in drug metabolism.296 Mutation A82F
raised the PFR with indole 170-fold by rendering the active
site less spacious,112 and enhanced the stereospeciﬁcity of
styrene epoxidation when combined with T438F, giving 64%
(R)-styrene oxide.239 The F87G mutant gave 92% of the (R)-oxide
with the same substrate.72
The enzyme was engineered to accept short-chain fatty acids
by installing a polar couplet modelled on the Arg47/Tyr51 duet
midway down the access channel (L75T/L181K).250 This double
mutant gave a kcat value of 43 s1 with hexanoic acid as against
3.8 s1 for WT, and also a lower KM value. Using the same
principle, tyrosine was introduced at Ser72 to help bias selectivity
in lauric acid oxidation with a view to preparing g- and d-lactone
precursors, the S72Y/V78A/F87A triple mutant giving 55%
hydroxylation between the (o-6)- and (o-9)-positions where
WT gave nil.119 I263G and I263A gave less dramatic shifts. An
F87G triple mutant gave 77% verbenol, a precursor to the
ﬂavouring additive verbenone, from ()-a-pinene, a signiﬁcant
improvement over the 20% given by the F87V analogue.275
F87Y enhanced the activity of certain variants towards nonnatural substrates such as testosterone.316,340 A portfolio of
double mutants capable of manipulating product distributions
in the oxidation of sundry terpenes,154,381 alkanes and
cycloalkanes339 was created from permutations of ﬁve hydrophobic mutations at two speciﬁc sites, Phe87 and Ala328.
Extension of this focused library to two further sites, Ala264
and Leu437, allowed still greater selectivity control.274 In a
comparable strategy, alanine was incorporated at permutations of eight targeted active-site positions to expedite the
oxidation of bulky substrates such as substituted monosaccharides and 11-a-hydroxyprogesterone, leading to
activity enhancements of up to eightfold.315 Finally, the
introduction of proline at the residue immediately to the
C-terminus side of the cysteine ligand gave a mutant that
exhibited remarkably high PFRs with non-natural substrates
(e.g. 60 s1 with propylbenzene vs. 11 s1 for WT).125,126
Unlike the other substitutions detailed here, I401P lies to the
proximal side of the haem iron. Mutation Q403P exhibited
similar, albeit more modest, rate-accelerating properties
(39 s1 with propylbenzene).355

Random mutagenesis, directed evolution and rational evolution

P25Q, the ﬁrst randomly generated P450BM3 mutation to be
reported, was found to weaken fatty acid binding and alter
product proﬁles,117 but limited interest was shown in this

approach prior to the discovery that active P450 variants
turned complex media cultures blue by oxidising the indole
produced from tryptophan degradation to indigo.382 This provided researchers with an eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective method for
screening libraries containing many hundreds of randomly
created variants for enhanced oxidase activity. In a pioneering
‘‘rational evolution’’ study, error-prone PCR was used to generate
a small number of indigo-producing P450BM3 mutants. All proved
to contain mutations at three speciﬁc residues, and a highly active
second-generation variant was created by site-saturating these
in turn: A74G/F87V/L188Q (GVQ).319 This oxidised a range of
non-natural substrates118 including PAHs,375 organophosphorus
pesticides376,383 and chlorinated dioxins,377 as well as branched
fatty acids.40 The GVQ variant and its component mutations
have since been applied in diverse contexts.237,269,275,295,298,318,349
The CYP102A3 homologue showed dramatically enhanced
activity relative to WTA3 (e.g. 35 s1 with capric acid vs.
0.8 s1).139 More surprisingly, it displayed slight o-hydroxylase
activity, on which basis it was itself subjected to directed evolution with the object of leveraging this capability, leading to the
identiﬁcation of the A330VA3 mutation. When this was used in
place of the original glutamine substitution in GVQA3, 1-octanol
formation from octane rose to ca. 50% of the product mix.152
This dovetailed with earlier site-speciﬁc mutagenesis research in
which the A1 homologue, A328VA1 had been successfully
deployed in a similar role326 (section 4.2).
The PFR-enhancing properties of the GVQ variant extend
to substrates that bear almost no structural resemblance to
indole (e.g. 9.8 s1 with pentane vs. 0.3 s1 for WT),303 as do
those of other variants identiﬁed via indigo screening.303
However, the chances of engineering successful variants
clearly improve if customised high-throughput screens involving substrates more closely related to those being targeted are
employed. The P450-mediated O-dealkylation of p-nitrophenoxycarboxylic acids (pNCAs) has been widely exploited in
this capacity as the yellow chromophore produced is readily
detectible (Scheme 1). This assay was ﬁrst used to identify
rational-evolution variants with enhanced activity towards shorterchain (C8–C10) fatty acids.330 Starting from an F87A platform, libraries with mutations at eight other sites of known
or likely importance were randomly generated and screened.
The most promising mutations were then combined in a
stepwise fashion to generate the V26T/R47F/A74G/F87A/
L188K variant.299 Activity was further enhanced when the
F87A base mutation was replaced with F87V.363 Both these
variants have been used in the development of improved
preparative-scale protocols.298,364,366 The assay was subsequently customised for in vivo use to allow more eﬃcient,
cost-eﬀective throughput.333 A medium-throughput version

has been created to allow the identiﬁcation of variants with
superior performance in a zinc-driven system (section 7.3).306
Other customised screening methods have been created to
assay for the formation of phenols,310,384 epoxides325,379 and
primary alcohols.152 An alkoxyresoruﬁn ﬂuorescence assay
for O-dealkylation was able to distinguish variants with an
aptitude for metabolising pharmaceuticals,301 and a continuousﬂow version with cost and eﬃciency advantages based on
allyloxyresoruﬁn ﬂuorescence detection has been used to crossscreen a library of mutants against 30 diﬀerent substrates.316
One of the earliest P450BM3 libraries of variants to be
reported230 was screened using an assay for the formation of
NADP+, which can be detected either ﬂuorometrically or
spectroscopically when treated with strong alkali.120 Screening
has been addressed as a review topic in its own right.385,386
In a variation to the pNCA protocol, p-nitrophenoxyoctane
dealkylation was used to screen for medium-chain alkane
hydroxylase activity. Successive rounds of directed evolution
yielded a variant capable of hydroxylating octane at enhanced
rates.351 Three further rounds gave rise to an 11-mutation
variant, 139-3, which oxidised alkanes as short as butane and
propane, substrates towards which WT showed negligible
activity.124 9-10A, a 13-mutation variant containing eight
of the substitutions from 139-3, showed enhanced activity
towards propane when two designed mutations were introduced (A82L and A328V, section 4.2).326 Screening from this
stage on was carried out using dimethylether as a propane
surrogate. Further modiﬁcations produced PMO, a variant
containing 24-mutations, including three in the BMR domain,
that showed 95% coupling eﬃciency with propane in vitro and
gave a TTN of 36 000.312 A well summarised account of this
work is available.387 Variant 35E11, which contained twelve of
the mutations in 9-10A, oxidised ethane at a PFR of 0.007 s1.320
In spite of the specialised screening techniques employed, the
rate-improving properties of the directed-evolution mutations
discovered were (like those of the GVQ variant) generic in
scope, 139-3 showing enhanced activity towards substrates
structurally unrelated to n-alkanes such as valencene and
limonene, as well as fatty acids.387 Speciﬁcity for short-chain
alkanes developed only when an important mutation was
discovered at an access channel residue (L188P).387 Though
destabilising, this increased coupling eﬃciency with propane
from 15% to 44%. Analogous directed evolution techniques
were used to create variants with enhanced peroxygenase
activity (‘‘21B3’’),123,335 thermostabilty (‘‘5H6’’)372 and
co-solvent tolerance.272 This research has been reviewed.388
Variants with the ability to metabolise pharmaceuticals were
developed using the alkoxyresoruﬁn ﬂuorescence screen
described above.301 Known site-speciﬁc mutations were ﬁrst
combined to give a triple mutant with activity 900-fold higher
than WT: R47L/F87V/L188Q. Activity towards drugs such as
acetaminophen and MDMA was still up to two orders of
magnitude lower than that shown by human P450s,235 but a
variant with 90-fold higher initial activity than human
CYP2D6 towards dextromethorphan was produced by subjecting this platform to directed evolution.367 Three inﬂuential
new mutations were identiﬁed—all at, or adjacent to, activesite residues: F81I, L86I and E267V. Indigo screening of an
unrelated directed-evolution library followed by ﬂuorescence
1236

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

screening for coumarin oxidation activity identiﬁed another
family of variants with an ability to metabolise pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen.347 The most promising of those
generated in the ﬁrst round of evolution, F162I/E228K, was
used as a template for the succeeding round, from which the
L188P mutation once more emerged as signiﬁcant. Docking
studies showed that Thr260 and Thr268 played important roles
in orientating coumarin in the active site by interacting with the
carbonyl oxygen, and suggested that these interactions were
stronger and more inﬂuential in the second-generation variants.
One of the more unusual directed-evolution variants to emerge
to date is the single-site proline mutant, A330P.303 Though
identiﬁed via indigo screening, this was selectively active towards
small non-natural substrates such as toluene and pentane relative
to WT. It also possessed selectivity-altering properties, giving 30%
o-propylphenol from propylbenzene vs. 1% for WT, which gave
99% 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Again the mutated residue was
adjacent to an access-channel residue (Pro329). Variant KT5, a
four-mutation variant containing both F87A and A330P identiﬁed
in the same screen, gave contrasting selectivity proﬁles, producing
78% 2-phenyl-1-propanol from propylbenzene, vs. nil for WT.
KSK19 and KT2, which contained four and ﬁve mutations
respectively, were more typical directed-evolution variants from
the same library, enhancing PFRs by an order of magnitude
relative to the respective base variants even though none of the
introduced mutations was in the active site. A directed-evolution
library created using an F87A/R47L/M354S platform yielded two
activity-enhancing mutations for use in zinc-driven systems,
V281G and D363H, the latter being the more inﬂuential.307
Site-saturation mutagenesis has been carried out on key
residues in the substrate pocket and along the access channel.
As early as 1993, the I-helix was targeted with the object
of altering substrate speciﬁcity.389 Variants with enhanced
activity have been created by targeting Arg47, Tyr51, Pro329,
Met354 and Leu437 using an F87A template.306,307,310 Val78
and Ala184 were site-saturated during the development of a
screen for variants with epoxygenase activity.325 A variant
suitable for playing a role in a multi-step synthesis of artemisinin, an anti-malarial drug, was developed from the R47L/
Y51F/F87A template by site-saturating Phe87, Ile263, Ala264,
and Ala328, leading to the inclusion of the A328L mutation.304
The majority of the residues shown in Fig. 4 were site-saturated
during the further development of two directed-evolution
variants, 9-10A and 21B3, for more specialised purposes, including sites adjacent to key active-site residues such as Phe81, Thr88,
Thr260, Ile401 and Thr438.297,312,320–322 Site-saturation
mutagenesis conﬁrmed that the L188P mutation discovered via
error-prone PCR was the optimum substitution at this position
for conversion of the enzyme into a propane hydroxylase.387
Phe87 was site-saturated as a means of exploring the importance
of F87V to a potent drug-metabolising variant.340 Finally, ﬁve
residues outside the active site (again identiﬁed by error-prone
PCR) were targeted during the creation of an indole hydroxylase:
Asp168, Ala225, Lys434, Glu435 and Lys440.349

(cockroach), a P450 of unknown structure that o-hydroxylates
farnesol, were substituted into P450BM3 in two key substrate
recognition regions, SRS1 and SRS5. One recombinant
showed a six-fold activity enhancement, while another gave
the terminal hydroxylation product, which is not formed by
WT P450BM3, in >50% yields. F87L, A328V and A330L were
the most inﬂuential mutations.32,115,324 This strategy was
redolent of earlier research in which a soluble form of CYP2E1
had been created by substituting the majority of the CYP2E1
sequence into BMP, while retaining the BMR domain.230
The same researchers also fused BMP to a ﬂavodoxin from
Desulfovibrio vulgaris to improve the electrochemical properties of the enzyme230,391 (section 7.3). Detailed studies of the
interactions between the two partners in the latter hybrid have
been carried out.231 Other microsomal P450 domains have
been fused to BMR, allowing the in vitro oxidation of substrates oxidised by mammalian P450s.189,392,393 Approximately 10% oxygenase activity was retained when BMR was
fused to the NOS haem domain.394
Chimeras comprising sections of CYP102A1, A2 and A3
have been reported.149,336,395 Two were active towards verapamil and astemizole, substrates towards which none of the
parents was active. Surprisingly, perhaps, the reductase
component was able to inﬂuence substrate speciﬁcity. A1
was ca. threefold more active towards 2-phenoxyethanol if
BMR was replaced with the A2 reductase domain, for
instance, but ca. threefold less active towards 12-pNCA.395
This approach has proved more eﬀective than directed evolution for producing variants with enhanced thermostability
proﬁles, and a method for predicting chimeric thermostability
from the sequence fragments involved has been developed.396
Unfortunately, there often appears to be a trade-oﬀ with
activity.309 Thus, although a fusion of BMP to a thermostable
reductase domain from a sulphite reductase was stable at
49 1C, fatty acid oxidation rates and coupling eﬃciency were
signiﬁcantly compromised.72 Similarly, a fusion between BMP
and the A3 reductase domain oﬀered superior process stability
but gave a TTN roughly one third as high as the A1 parent.150
Finally, thermostability has been enhanced by fusing an
archaeal cis-trans isomerise known to function as a molecular
chaperone to full-length P450BM3 at the N-terminus.346

Practical applications

A number of purposes can be served by altering the phenylalanine side-chain of Phe87. Mutation F87Y has been employed
to probe peroxynitrite inactivation, which was found to take
place selectively at Tyr334 in the wild-type enzyme.344 The
F87G mutant deformylated aldehydes, leading to the formation of haem adducts,342 though the enzyme retained some
oxidase activity, which does not occur when the reaction is
performed with other isoforms.121 The same mutant was used
to explore P450 reaction intermediates,223 and in a study of spin
state equilibria.220 The F87A mutant played roles in investigations into the binding of multiple substrates in the active site,122
and co-solvent inactivation, to which it was more susceptible
than WT.273 It has been a popular platform for rational and
directed evolution,272,299,303,304,335 and was prominent in the
development of the pNCA screen.330 This research was guided

by a report (since questioned, section 3.2.2) that the F87A
mutant o-hydroxylated fatty acids, which implied that the
dealkylation of medium-chain pNCAs might be favoured by
F87A over competing sub-terminal hydroxylation pathways.
The mutant duly proved superior to WT in the assay, but in
practice this probably owed a good deal to the enhanced activesite water presence, which is conducive to the binding of polar
substrates.328 It is no coincidence that the pNCA assay is also
eﬀective at identifying variants with enhanced peroxygenase
activity123 (section 7.3), which almost invariably contain F87A
(or F87G).123,332 The F87A mutation has since been employed
in the development of other dealkylation-based assays.306,310
Other residues have been mutated for a variety of unconnected reasons. The Y51F mutant was used to demonstrate that
Tyr51 was a principal nitration site following the binding and
subsequent dissociation of NO.311 Cysteine was introduced at
Leu104, and Gln387, two sites implicated in FMN/BMP
binding, prior to dansylation. The impact on inter-domain
electron transfer was then assessed, the E372C mutant being
employed as a control.177 Rapid haem reduction could be
eﬀected photochemically (2.5  106 s1 and 4.6  105 s1 with
and without substrate bound) by tethering a ruthenium
complex to Q387C.348 A ruthenium photosensitiser was linked
to a K97C variant to allow the high-valent iron intermediates
generated by photoexcitation to be studied.314 In all cases, the
naturally occurring cysteine at residue 156 was blocked using
serine. C156S was subsequently used as part of a protocol to
immobilise the protein on a gold electrode (section 7.3),
together with C62S.198 BMP was ‘‘wired’’ to a graphite electrode by attaching pyrene to the Q387C mutant.354 All thirteen
methionine residues in BMP were replaced with norleucine,
with the aim of limiting inactivation via methionine oxidation,
resulting in a small increase in peroxygenase activity but a
decrease in thermostability.397 Surprisingly, perhaps, applications have also been found for randomly generated P450BM3
mutations. Stability was shown to enhance an enzyme’s
capacity to evolve;360 and genetic drift was explored as a general
topic by evolving the enzyme under conditions designed to
enhance a speciﬁc activity type and monitoring the impact on
other, unrelated activity types.361,362 Various mutations not
detailed in Table 3 were generated in this work. On a similar
theme, the enzyme has been the subject of an investigation into
whether transversion mutations (purine to pyrimidine, or vice
versa) are adaptively superior to transition mutations (purine to
purine, or pyrimidine to pyrimidine).398

Exploring mutants and variants

5.1 Crystal structures
Several of the earliest mutant crystal structures to be published
were broadly identical to the SF WT structure, including those
of SF T268A (PDB codes 1FAH255 and 1YQO),107 T268N
(1YQP),107 F393H (1JME),259 F393A, F393W and F393Y
(1P0V, 1P0W and 1P0X).258 The highly plastic F/G loop
and the ﬁnal turns of the helices to either side (residues
189–200) were unresolved in all but one of these structures.
In the T268A structure, the carbonyl oxygen of Ala264,
though unable to hydrogen-bond to the side-chain of the

mutated residue, remained hydrogen-bonded to the axial water
molecule.255 In the T268N mutant, the introduced residue was
hydrogen-bonded to the Thr438 side-chain.107 In the F393A
mutant, the Gln403 side-chain was displaced into the space
vacated by the phenyl ring of the substituted residue.258
SF and palmitoleiate-bound structures have been published
for the A264E mutant (1SMI and 1SMJ),352 which was
prepared with the idea of improving stability by linking the
prosthetic haem group covalently to the protein. A conserved
glutamate residue at the homologous position performs this
function in eukaryotic CYP4 isoforms.399 Rather than esterifying with the porphyrin system, however, the introduced
residue displayed a capacity to coordinate to the haem iron in
place of the axial water ligand. In the palmitoleiate-bound
structure, it was ligated in both molecules of the asymmetric
unit, while in the SF structure it was ‘‘on’’ in molecule A and
‘‘oﬀ’’ in molecule B, where the axial site was instead occupied
by a water ligand. According to spectroscopic data, the ‘‘oﬀ’’
conformation was 75–80% populated in solution. The same
ambivalent coordinative tendencies were observed in the
structures of A264H, A264K (2IJ3 and 2IJ4),244 A264C,
A264M and A264Q (3EKB, 3EKD and 3EKF).109 A fatty
acid was bound in one molecule of the A264M asymmetric
unit, but the other mutants were crystallised in the SF form.
With the exception of A264H, all these structures nonetheless
overlaid more closely onto the SB form of WT than onto the
SF form (rmsd: 0.5 Å vs. 1.4 Å for A264E, for example). The
structures of L86E, F261E and I401E (3KX3, 3KX5 and
3KX4), which were created with similar aims to the A264E
mutant, have also been solved.193 These showed the introduced glutamate linking neither to the porphyrin nor to the
haem iron, though EPR studies suggested some haem ligation
in the two distal-side mutants. The water molecule closest to
the haem iron in the L86E mutant, which was crystallised in
the NPG-bound form, was partitioned between the axial
ligation site (ca. 35% occupancy) and the ‘‘alternative’’,
oﬀ-centre water site, showing that the presence of substrate
and axial water ligation were not mutually incompatible.
Tenacious substrate binding meant that two high-activity
variants, A82F and 139-3, could be crystallised only in an SB
condition. The A82F structure (2UWH)112 showed palmitic
acid bound with the carboxylate group closer to the protein
surface than in WT, and the hydrogen bond to Tyr51
disrupted. It appeared that active-site residues such as Ile263
and Leu437 adopted SB orientations not as a result of the
presence of substrate but on account of the bulky substitution,
and it was suggested that the mutant would probably exist in
the SB conformation even in the absence of substrate. A water
molecule lay within 3.5 Å of the haem iron in only one of the
six molecules in the asymmetric unit, showing that occupation
of the ‘‘alternative’’ water binding site was not a mandatory
feature of the SB or high-spin form, and consistent with the
unusual inability of the SB mutant to move to the low-spin
form on temperature reduction. NPG-bound 139-3 (3CBD)387
superposed relatively well onto the NPG-bound WT structure
(rmsd = 0.5 Å), the greatest deviations being at the N-terminus
end and residues 45–47, 243–247 and 380–383. The hydrophobic pocket enclosing the haem iron was 29 Å3 more capacious
than in WT, primarily on account of the V78A substitution.
1238

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

Leu437 was in contact with the A184V substitution across
the substrate access channel. Models based on this structure
suggested that mutation A328F, which was subsequently
incorporated into 139-3 to create a more eﬀective alkane
hydroxylase, would compartmentalise the active site, creating
a more tightly enclosed inner pocket. 22A3, a precursor of
directed-evolution variants with enhanced activity towards
substrates metabolised by human CYP2C9, was crystallised
in the SF form (3Q18).309 This structure overlaid closely onto
SB WT structures and those of A264 mutants, which exist in
SB conformations (vide supra), but poorly onto SF structures.
The B 0 helix was more ﬂexible than in SF WT due to the L75R
mutation, which appeared to contribute signiﬁcantly to the
altered substrate speciﬁcity.
Three further high-activity variants were crystallised in the
SF form: A330P (3M4V), I401P (3HF2) and KT2 (3PSX). In all
three structures, the F/G loop was unresolved in at least one
molecule, as were portions of the ﬂanking helices. In the A330P
structure,126 the positions of the backbone atoms of the
mutated residue were relatively little changed, but Pro329, the
adjoining residue was displaced into the substrate access channel,
possibly because this was less disruptive to the b1 sheet. The
resulting constriction to the area around the haem iron provided a structural basis for the selectivity-altering properties
displayed by the variant and the enhanced activity shown
towards smaller substrates relative to WT. I401P125,126 and
KT2,194 by contrast, exhibited little disruption in the immediate
vicinity of the mutated residues, but resembled SB forms of the
enzyme in key respects. In both structures, the proximal loop
dropped away from the active site, drawing the haem iron to the
proximal side of the porphyrin plane (cf. Fig. 3D). The I-helix
kink angle was reduced due to changes in hydrogen-bonding
patterns in the dioxygen activation region, the reorientation of
the carbonyl oxygen of Gly265 being particularly inﬂuential
(cf. Fig. 3C). In addition, each variant possessed SB-like
characteristics not shared by the other. Thus the nearest water
molecule to the haem iron in I401P lay 3.6 Å distant, oﬀ-axial
and close to the ‘‘alternative’’ site identiﬁed in SB WT, whereas
the KT2 structure instead showed a water molecule 2.6 Å from
the haem iron, as in SF WT—albeit too far from the I-helix to
hydrogen bond to Ala264. At the same time, the two ion pairs
linking the G- and I-helices were disrupted in KT2, as was the
ion pair pinning the H-helix to the F/G loop (cf. Fig. 3B), and
the side-chains of Phe87, Phe158, Phe261 and His266 were in
SB WT conformations (cf. Fig. 3C and D), changes that were
not apparent in the I401P structure. It was suggested that these
two variants—particularly KT2—were in catalytically primed
conformations in which the reorganisation energy barrier associated with the ﬁrst ﬂavin-to-haem electron transfer was lower
than in WT—i.e. the role of substrate-induced conformational
change was reduced. How the introduced mutations had
brought about the changes was unclear. Another structure that
resembles SB WT even though crystallised in the SF form is that
of the ruthenium photosensitiser-linked C62A/K97C/C156S
variant (3NPL).314
Other mutant structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank but
as yet undiscussed in publications by the providers include A328S
(1ZO4), NPG-bound A328V (1ZOA), Q403K (2NNB), F87A/
T268A (3DGI) and DMSO-bound F87A (2X7Y and 2X80).

5.2 Biophysical properties, catalytic parameters and binding
constants
5.2.1. Reduction potentials. Reduction potentials (E) have
been determined for several families of mutants, both in the SF
form and when bound with diﬀerent substrates (Table 4).
E generally becomes more oxidising on substrate binding due
to displacement of the axial water ligand, the extent of the shift
being substrate-dependent. Thus arachidonate, a preferred
substrate, induces larger increases in the reduction potential
than palmitate, which in turn induces larger increases than
propylbenzene, a non-natural substrate. However, the potentials shown by A264E,108 A264M244 and I401P125 showed little
change on substrate binding, as they were already signiﬁcantly
more oxidising than that of WT in the SF form. In the case of
the Ala264 mutants, the unusual ligand sets involved may have
been responsible. With I401P, a possible explanation was
provided by the crystal structure, which showed the nearest
water molecule to the haem iron to be remote and oﬀ-axial,
consistent with the fact that the haem domain was already
ca. 90% high-spin in the SF form. More challenging to
account for are the elevated SF E values exhibited by three
other proximal-side mutants F393A, F393H258 and I401E,193
whose water ligands lay in conventional axial SF positions in
the corresponding crystal structures. The reduction potentials
of these variants increased still further on substrate binding,
accompanied by normal type I spin shifts from Z 90% lowspin resting states. It was believed for a time that potentials
could be inﬂuenced by the network of hydrogen bonds formed
by the sulphur atom of the axial cysteine ligand.400 This
network can be disrupted by proximal-side mutations, potentially explaining the observed potential shifts. However, the
Fe–S stretching frequency remained unaltered when Phe393
was mutated,213 while the I401P mutation had the opposite
eﬀect on the reduction potential to its P450cam homologue,126
so arguments along such lines do not appear to provide a
satisfactory explanation for these data. An alternative suggestion is that potentials reﬂect the extent to which the vinyl
groups of the porphyrin system are in-plane, as well as the
conformations adopted by the propionate groups.213
As discussed in section 2.2, the physiological relevance of
thermodynamic parameters determined under anaerobic conditions is open to debate. Moreover, it is apparent from
Table 4 that little or no indication of a variant’s catalytic
activity can be obtained either from its SF reduction potential
or from the shift in potential that a substrate induces.258
Closer attention is therefore paid to FMN-to-haem electron
transfer rates, kinetic parameters measured in the full-length
protein that have a direct bearing on kcat values.
5.2.2. Electron transfer rates. The rate of the ﬁrst FMN-tohaem electron transfer, kf has been determined in various fulllength SF and SB mutants (Table 4). kf is generally r5 s1 in
the absence of substrate, but signiﬁcantly higher when a viable
substrate is bound. As with the reduction potential, the extent
of the increase is substrate-dependent. kf values of 226 s1 and
38.5 s1 were determined for WT bound with palmitic acid
and propylbenzene respectively, for example.194 The correlation between E and kf is reasonable for SB variants with

relatively low reduction potentials, as with P450cam,402 but less
good for variants with more oxidising potentials (Fig. 5). The
glutamate mutants, L86E, F261E and I401E have potentials
between 166 mV and 197 mV in the arachidonate-bound
form, but kf values that range from 58 to 473 s1, for
instance.193 Such dichotomies are wholly consistent with Marcus
theory, which indicates that the activation energy associated
with electron transfer is a function not only of the reduction
potential but also of the energies associated with the accompanying inner-sphere (e.g. Fe–OH2 bond cleavage) and outersphere (e.g. changes in protein conformation) reorganisation.192
An illustration of how dominant the structural component can
be is provided by the substrate-free form of variant KT2, which
displayed an E value of 405 mV (vs. 449 mV for SF WT),
but a kf value of 209 s1 (vs. 1.5 s1).194 The crystal structure of
this variant showed a close resemblance to those of substratebound forms of WT (section 5.1), indicating that the level of
reorganization associated with substrate binding would be
signiﬁcantly lower than in WT.
KT2 is not the only variant to exhibit a high kf value in the SF
form. Similar behaviour has been observed in I401E, L86E193
and I401P.126 Each of these variants showed a higher rate of
NADPH consumption in the absence of substrate (leak rate)
than WT. (Early research on WT suggested that such leakage
takes place exclusively from the BMR domain.)104 The I401P
leak rate (7.6 s1 in vitro vs. 0.5 s1 for WT),126 though just 3% of
the respective kf value, was probably suﬃcient to place any
expression host under metabolic stress, but in KT2 the leak rate
was an order of magnitude lower at 0.8 s1 (0.4% of kf).194 The
ﬁrst electron transfer is therefore not the only step ‘‘gating’’
the catalytic cycle to guard against futile electron cycling and the
associated generation of unwanted reactive oxygen species.
Evidently a mechanism exists in these mutants for preventing
the rapid reduction of dioxygen to water or peroxide by NADPH
in the absence of substrate even if FMN-to-haem electron
transfer has already taken place, and it seems likely that the
same applies in WT. This throws up a perplexing paradox: KT2
is active towards substrates that do not ﬁt the active site
particularly well, apparently because substrate-induced conformational change is no longer essential for rapid FMN-to-haem
electron transfer; yet NADPH consumption rates are negligible
in the SF form, in which the ﬁrst electron transfer is also rapid,
showing that the variant commits to catalysis only if a substrate
is present—i.e. substrate-induced conformational change of some
description appears to be as crucial to subsequent steps in the
catalytic cycle in this variant as it is in WT.
Discussion of the relationship between kf and kcat is
complicated by the fact that the data published for the
wild-type enzyme with fatty acid substrates lack consistency
(Tables 2 and 4). This is partly because diﬀerent research
groups employ diﬀerent experimental conditions. kf is sensitive
to temperature, buﬀer composition127 and NADPH preincubation times,187 all of which can therefore inﬂuence kcat values.
pH is important,19,34 as are the length of time for which a
substrate is preincubated with the enzyme prior to NADPH
addition,19,113,199 and the solvent in which it is prepared. The
KD value given by WT with aqueous lauric acid is 150% higher
than that obtained if an organic co-solvent is used to make up
the stock solution, for instance,106 and there are corresponding

P450BM3 and variants. Data are from Table 4. Reduction potentials

literature being 139 s1 for tetradecyltrimethylammonium
bromide oxidation.63 Being generally more rapid in P450BM3
than other isoforms,182 kf is not necessarily rate-determining,
as it is, for example, in P450cam when putidaredoxin is in
excess.403 Subsequent steps in the cycle such as the second
FMN-to-haem electron transfer, dioxygen activation and product
release play a more signiﬁcant role in rate limitation,105 though
the extent to which this occurs varies by substrate and by
mutant. Apparent kcat/kf values were respectively 77%, 62%
and 40% for the oxidation of lauric, myristic and palmitic
acids by WT, for instance.127
Against this background, P450BM3 variants fall loosely into
three categories when kf and kcat values are compared.
kf exceeded kcat by an order of magnitude or more in arachidonatebound variants containing F393A, F393H107,258 and I401E,193
suggesting that a subsequent step in the cycle was rate-limiting.258
These mutations increased the substrate-bound ﬁrst electron
transfer rate two- to three-fold relative to WT, implying that
accelerated haem reduction was catalytically undesirable, and it
was suggested that there could be a trade-oﬀ between the rate at
which this took place and the dioxygen binding rate.257 Variants
in the second category gave catalytic rates approximately half as
fast as the corresponding ﬁrst electron transfer rate. Examples
include L86E, F393Y, I401P and KT2—the latter whether
bound with palmitic acid or with propylbenzene. In several data
sets, WT also ﬁtted this paradigm. Here, both the ﬁrst electron
transfer rate and one or more subsequent steps in the catalytic
cycle played roles in limiting the catalytic rate. Variants in the
third category gave apparent kcat values equal to, or greater than,
the corresponding kf values. Most of these were investigated only
in the laurate-bound form, where kcat signiﬁcantly exceeded the
NADPH consumption rate observed at the laurate concentration
used to determine kf because the associated KM values were
relatively high. Mutant F42A gave kf and kcat values of 10 s1
and 41 s1 respectively, for example, but an NADPH consumption rate of just 11 s1 since the KM value was 2.1 mM.106
However, arachidonate-bound T268A, T268N107 and F393W258
also fell under this heading, as kf was signiﬁcantly below the WT
value at o30 s1. This suggests that kf becomes rate-limiting only
if it is severely curtailed.

Why kf should be rate-limiting for WT with arachidonic
acid is therefore something of a mystery (kf = 250 s1, kcat =
273 s1 at 25 1C),193 particularly given that kcat/kf ratios
decrease as active site saturation becomes more facile across
the lauric/myristic/palmitic acid series (vide supra). As to
which steps in the cycle contribute to rate-limitation in other
circumstances, there is an implication that the collapse in
catalytic rates that occurs as ionic strength is reduced127 is
not related to the second electron transfer. This is because the
latter is probably governed by considerations similar to those
that govern kf, such as the ease with which the haem iron is
able to move in and out of the porphyrin plane, which may in
turn be inﬂuenced by the positioning of the proximal loop, to
which the axial cysteine ligand belongs.194 It would be surprising
if one was ionic strength-dependent but not the other.
5.2.3. Catalytic parameters. Apparent kcat and KM values
have been determined for numerous variants. With fatty acid
substrates, mutagenesis has frequently had the eﬀect of
lowering catalytic eﬃciency (kcat/KM), conﬁrming the importance of the role played by the naturally occurring residue
(Table 5). Interestingly, the four proximal-side mutants with
elevated SF reduction potentials (F393A, F393H, I401E and
I401P) all showed higher catalytic eﬃciency than WT with
lauric acid by virtue of giving lower apparent KM values. With
arachidonic acid, which saturates the active site more readily,
however, the KM eﬀect was outweighed by the impact of a
reduction in the associated kcat value, and catalytic eﬃciency
decreases were recorded.
With non-natural substrates, by contrast, engineered alterations have often brought about catalytic eﬃciency enhancements, whether as a result of increased kcat values, a lowering
of KM values, or a combination of the two (Table 6). Reductions in KM often bring about more dramatic activity increases
under standard turnover conditions, as it is the inability of
non-natural substrates to saturate the active site that is
primarily responsible for the desultory rates of oxidation
observed with WT. The KM value associated with p-nitrophenol
oxidation is dauntingly high, for example: 16 mM, rising to
22 mM in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase.121
However, this value fell to 2.8 mM when the F87G mutation
was introduced. If activity enhancement is the sole objective,
reductions to KM and enhancements to kcat should ideally be
engineered in concert. This paradigm was successfully followed
through successive generations of evolution targeted at creating
a propane hydroxylase. The ﬁnished variant exhibited kcat and
KM values of 7.6 s1 and 170 mM for propane, as against
0.03 s1 and 30 mM for the base variant, 139-3, which was itself
signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the wild-type enzyme.387 If
selectivity control and activity enhancement are both required
in a variant, however, the case for engineering reductions to KM
is less compelling, since structural modiﬁcations that allow a
substrate to saturate the active site more readily may achieve
this end by enabling it to bind in a wider range of orientations.
Mutagenesis at Phe87 had little impact on apparent KM
values with hydrophobic substrates, but typically lowered
them with substrates containing an element of polarity such
as phenols345 and b-ionone,295 while the R47L/Y51F double
substitution had the opposite eﬀect. These diﬀerences seem

state equilibrium induced by substrate binding. Like reduction
potentials, however, these parameters are not always good
indicators of catalytic performance. To illustrate, arachidonic
acid binding was tightened by a factor of 25 in the L86E mutant
relative to WT, yet catalytic eﬃciency was diminished by a
factor of 5, in part because the KM value more than doubled.193
With lauric acid, on the other hand, the same mutant enhanced
catalytic eﬃciency by a factor of 4 on the back of a 90-fold
tightening in binding, albeit from a lower level. There is an
inference that excessively tight binding may be counterproductive.

a reliable guide to binding avidity. With naphthalene, for
example, the F87V mutant gave a spin shift of 73%, vs. 15%
for WT, but the dissociation constants of the two enzymes fell
within 5% of one another.375 The correlation between spin
shifts and catalytic activity can also be poor. For example,
F87A variants gave higher spin shifts than WT with a range of
non-natural substrates—possibly because the enhanced activesite water presence stabilised the ‘‘alternative’’ water binding
site—while those given by A330P variants were lower, yet activity
trends ran in the opposite sense.303 Other variants that show
enhanced activity relative to WT despite giving meagre spin shifts
on substrate addition have been reported.249,256,380 Where polar
substrates are involved, the binding of a heteroatom atom close
to the haem iron may in fact enhance the stability of the axial
water binding site rather than diminishing it.256 These observations serve as a reminder that displacement of the axial water
ligand is merely one of the events that the arrival of a substrate in
the active site may bring about. Substrate-induced structural

important, and the preferred substrate binding mode must also
be conducive to eﬃcient product expulsion following oxidation if
eﬃcient catalysis is to take place.
5.3 Structure-function studies
Intimate insights into aspects of P450 chemistry such as the
interplay between competing reaction pathways have been
obtained through investigations into the oxidation of structurally related substrates by diﬀerent P450BM3 variants. Studies
of non-natural substrate oxidation typically require the involvement of high-activity variants to ensure that NADPH consumption rates reach practicable levels. Selectivity-altering
mutations are then incorporated to produce a variety of product
outcomes. In the oxidation of 3- to 8-carbon n-alkanes by
directed-evolution variants, activity was highest for the 6-carbon
compound, falling away as the chain lengthened or shortened.124
This contrasted with straight-chain fatty acid oxidation,
where activity was highest for the 15-carbon compound.16

The speciﬁcity for sub-terminal hydroxylation was retained,
however, o-hydroxylation accounting for r2% of the products formed by 6- to 10-carbon alkanes.326 With hexane,
variant 139-3 gave similar 2-hexanol : 3-hexanol ratios to
WT (20% : 80%), but with octane, 2-octanol formation ran
at 66%, as compared to 17% for WT.124 With decane, on the
other hand, 139-3 gave just 15% 2-decanol. Introduction of
the A328V mutation drove the focus of attack towards the
o- and (o-1)-positions across the full gamut of substrates,326
octane and decane both giving ca. 80% (o-1)-hydroxylation,
and further mutagenesis resulted in a variant capable of
producing 52% 1-octanol from octane.322 However, the same
variant gave just 5% 1-decanol from decane, illustrating the
measure of the challenge faced by selectivity engineers. Highactivity variants may be generic in reach, but selectivity alteration
typically needs to be addressed on a substrate-by-substrate basis,
particularly where unfunctionalised substrates are concerned.
The desaturation of alkylbenzenes has been probed using an
unrelated family of directed-evolution variants.337 Those containing the F87A mutation, which creates space in the active
site, gave the highest desaturation/hydroxylation ratios. The
alkyl side-chain structure also inﬂuenced product proﬁles,
ab-desaturation being most favoured when the a carbon was
branched and the b carbon primary. Cumene (isopropylbenzene) gave almost 30% desaturation with F87A variants,
for example, while n-propylbenzene gave r1%. a-Hydroxylation
was the principal competing pathway in most instances, but
one variant gave >75% b-hydroxylation with n-propylbenzene, and small quantities of b-hydroxylation (up to 4%)
even when the b carbon was primary. These patterns suggested
that the ﬁrst of the two hydrogen abstractions required to
accomplish desaturation might take place from the b carbon
rather than the more activated a carbon, with electron transfer
followed by rearrangement to the more stable a carbocation
completing the mechanism, as in certain microsomal P450s.406
However, isotope studies showed that the ﬁrst abstraction in
fact took place from the a carbon, making the role played by
the side-chain branch more challenging to explain. One possibility is that it causes substrates to adopt diﬀerent binding
orientations to those favoured by straight-chain analogues.
An unusually vivid demonstration of metabolic switching
came to light during this investigation, the oxidation of
a-D-cumene by WT yielding 48% o-a-D-isopropylphenol, as
compared to 9% for the non-deuterated substrate. This illustrated the delicacy of the balance that exists between the
diﬀerent competing oxidative pathways and delineated the
extent to which the enzyme was capable of distinguishing
between C–H bonds of diﬀering reactivity. Density functional
theory calculations have been carried out to rationalise an
example of the same phenomenon in the oxidation of ethylbenzene by a microsomal isoform.407 Yet the level of switching in
that instance was o3%, showing that oxidation outcomes
depend crucially on the isoform and substrate involved.
Moreover, F87A-containing P450BM3 variants gave no o-hydroxylation with cumene or any other alkylbenzene substrate,
making it clear that bond activation levels only inﬂuence outcomes if the architecture of the active site allows. Similar
considerations apply to the partition between desaturation and
hydroxylation. Theoreticians have suggested that desaturation
1246

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

takes place via a cationic pathway that operates only when
radical rebound is inhibited both electronically and sterically.408
It is therefore interesting that desaturation in P450BM3, which is
initiated by a-abstraction, should be favoured in substrates
capable of stabilising an a carbocation intermediate. While this
strengthens the impression that a cationic pathway is involved,
desaturation appears to compete freely with a-, b- and
o-hydroxylation, and it is far from clear that inhibition of a
radical rebound is required if it is to take place. P450BM3 variants
make particularly suitable test systems for mechanistic hypotheses of this kind,8,9 allowing a clearer understanding of the
extent to which steric considerations or experimental conditions
compromise the assumptions on which they are predicated.
Isotope eﬀects have been used to probe the oxidation of
7-ethoxycoumarin by a panel of P450BM3 variants.368 Perdeuteration of the methylene group led to a reduction in the kcat
values associated with O-deethylation of roughly an order of
magnitude across all variants, but little change to those associated with the competing 3-hydroxylation reaction. Metabolic
switching was therefore not evident in this instance, probably
because this would have required full rotation of the substrate
in the active site, the hydroxylation and deethylation sites being
situated at opposite ends of the bicyclic structure. However,
the partition between the two products was sensitive to the
mutations employed, A264G-containing variants giving
O-deethylation percentages close to or above 50%, while
F86I-containing variants gave percentages as low as 15%.
Activity was greatest for those variants that showed a bias
towards 3-hydroxylation, which is the same bias as that shown
by human CYP1A2 and 2E1. Isotope eﬀects have been cleverly
used to ascertain how compact a substrate needs to be for rotation
in the P450BM3 active site to be suﬃciently rapid to inﬂuence
product distributions.254 p-Xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene) showed
a full isotope eﬀect when one methyl group was perdeuterated,
demonstrating that rapid rotation of the substrate allowed hydroxylation to take place predominantly at the non-deuterated
methyl group. With 4,4 0 -dimethylbiphenyl, however, an isotope
eﬀect of just 2.5 was observed when one methyl group was
perdeuterated, showing that rotation was restricted—albeit not
to the extent seen in the 7-ethoxycoumarin investigation
described above. When this experiment was repeated with the
F87A mutant, a full isotope eﬀect was restored, by implication in
response to the additional space created in the active site.
Outcomes in the oxidation of alkylbenzenes with singlecarbon side-chains were signiﬁcantly impacted by active-site
mutations. WT gave 98% o-cresol (2-methylphenol) from
toluene, but KT5, a variant containing mutations F87A and
A330P, gave 95% benzylalcohol.303 A possible explanation is
that the reshaped active site of KT5 allowed the substrate
suﬃcient freedom to ﬁnd a binding orientation in which the
activated benzylic carbon could be presented to the haem iron
for oxidation. However, this does not reconcile with the
corresponding results for propylbenzene, where benzylic
hydroxylation levels dropped from 99% in WT to 20% in
KT5. A more satisfactory interpretation is therefore that the
substituent plays a role in orientating alkylbenzene substrates
in the active site. The product proﬁles obtained in the oxidation of diﬀerent xylene isomers by WT and assorted variants
showed that the relative positioning of multiple substituents

on an aromatic ring is also important. m-Xylene, like toluene,
gave 98% aromatic hydroxylation with WT, but o-xylene gave
53%305 while p-xylene gave only benzylic hydroxylation.254
With F87A variants, benzylic hydroxylation percentages were
signiﬁcantly higher for m- and o-xylene, such that product
distributions resembled those given by microsomal P450s. This
adds to the growing body of evidence that P450BM3 can be a
relevant and useful model for the metabolism of xenobiotics
by higher organisms, particularly when judiciously mutated.
Five oxidation products were formed by o-xylene, including
two that entailed the NIH shifting of one of the methyl
substituents, in one case leading to dearomatisation, a reaction
seldom encountered beyond the conﬁnes of esoteric text
books. These ﬁndings highlight the usefulness of the enzyme
as a probe for unusual P450 reactivity types and the mechanistic pathways by which they proceed.

The oxidation of non-natural substrates
Pharmaceuticals and other biomolecules74

With the enzyme now ﬁrmly established as an adaptable
oxidation platform, attention is focusing increasingly on the
development of dedicated applications for speciﬁc non-natural
substrate categories. Pharmaceuticals have been particularly
heavily targeted. Understanding the degradation and clearance behaviour of new products is critical as drug metabolites
can often be pharmacologically active, and are as likely to
cause adverse side-eﬀects as the drugs from which they originate by reacting with endogenous or unconnected exogenous
molecules.309,409 In most countries, information about which
human P450s are responsible for metabolism is required
before a drug candidate can be submitted for approval.
Although human enzymes can be expressed in yeast and
E. coli, they do not lend themselves readily to metabolite
production as they are relatively unstable and exhibit low
activity. Researchers have therefore turned to surrogate P450s
for solutions. Early investigations involving wild-type P450BM3
suggested that compounds such as progesterone,19 benzphetamine, cocaine and 7-ethoxycoumarin (an O-dealkylation
probe)63 were not accepted as substrates, though other work
indicated that coumarins and steroids might be viable targets.24
Against this background, chimeragenesis (section 4.4) was
used to create enzymes capable of oxidising chlorzoxazone,393
diclofenac,189 omeprazole189 and erythromycin,189 BMR being
fused to CYP2E1, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 respectively. Subsequent
studies showed that WT P450BM3 was in fact capable of oxidising
selected drugs,404 and CYP102A7 was found to be active towards
7-ethoxycoumarin.143 The enzyme is more active towards drugs
metabolised by human 3A4 and 2E1 isoforms, with which it
shares higher levels of sequence similarity, than those processed
by the 1A2, 2C9 and 2D6 sub-families.404 This is potentially
advantageous, since 3A4 is involved in the metabolism of
approximately 50% of the drugs currently on the market, while
other P450s collectively metabolise just 25%.410
The demethylation metabolite from colchicine, a 3A4 substrate, has been produced in a bioreactor using a CYP102A1
gene isolated from a wild B. megaterium strain.411 Engineered
P450BM3 variants have given product arrays broadly similar

to those given by microsomal P450s (though in altered
proportions) with 7-ethoxycoumarin368 and numerous diﬀerent
pharmaceuticals,235,236,297,309,328,350,369,371,374 often in enhanced
yields. CYP102A5 and A7 have been engineered to oxidise
chlorzoxazone and diclofenac.153 Novel metabolites have been
identiﬁed during these studies, as well as several overlooked in
earlier work carried out with more ‘‘appropriate’’ P450s. Such
investigations are typically conducted using a portfolio of
variants rather than a single customised catalyst, partly because
pharmaceuticals are structurally diverse and do not respond in
a common fashion to particular mutations, and partly because
this improves the probability of generating all the necessary
metabolites, since diﬀerent variants give contrasting and sometimes complementary product proﬁles. With verapamil, for
example, one variant gave ﬁve metabolites at a high overall
conversion (78%), while ﬁve additional metabolites could be
generated using less productive variants, two in high
percentages.296,396 Portfolios may consist exclusively of variants
developed for drug metabolism.236,256,316,340,350,367 Alternatively, a mixture of customised and non-customised variants
can be employed. Customised variants performed more
eﬀectively than mutants developed for PAH oxidation with
several substrates,368–371 but non-customised variants gave superior
performance with pharmaceuticals such as astemiziole, an antihistamine,296 showing that a ﬂexible approach can pay worthwhile
dividends. Fig. 6 depicts a selection of the drugs towards which
WT or engineered variants have been reported as showing activity.
Metabolites have been produced from several of these.

Fluorinated pharmaceuticals, which oﬀer various beneﬁts
including enhanced membrane permeability, have been
produced by regioselective hydroxylation of a substrate

followed by displacement of the introduced hydroxyl group
using diethylaminosulphur triﬂuoride.313 The enzyme has been
used in multi-step drug synthesis pathways. Artemisinic acid
was produced via the selective epoxidation of one of the two
unsaturated linkages in amorpha-4,11-diene using a P450BM3
variant.304 Chemical methods were then employed to generate
artemisinin, an anti-malarial agent. Other biomolecules have
been targeted. The oxidation of bilirubin was stimulated by the
presence of perﬂuorolauric acid.405 As with the stimulation of
CYP1 oxidation by polychlorinated biphenyls, this appeared
to result from co-occupation of the active site by the two
substrates. Co-incubation with lauric acid, the unsubstituted
analogue, stimulated NADPH consumption rates but not
bilirubin oxidation, presumably because the co-substrate
could itself be oxidised. The enzyme has been engineered to
accept and demethylate permethylated saccharides.308 This
potentially facilitates saccharide synthesis by allowing protecting
groups to be removed en bloc without compromising regioselectivity. A BMP variant capable of functioning as a
dopamine-sensitive MRI contrast agent has been engineered.323
The contrast eﬀects achieved were weaker than those of
synthetic agents, but could be augmented by employing the
Mn3+-substituted variant in place of the ferric variant.412
Finally, a variant has been shown to give the same catechol
metabolites from zearalenone as human P450s.317

Alcoholic functionality is common in ﬂavour and fragrance
compounds, making them natural targets for P450 engineers.
Several are potentially available via the oxidation of naturally
occurring terpenes. More often than not, epoxides are sideproducts in such reactions, but these too can be of value, being
pheromones, fragrances and constituents of juvenile hormones
in insects. They are also useful as synthetic intermediates302—
in the production of the aggregation pheromone of the
Colorado potato beetle, for example.413 a-Ionone was one of
the ﬁrst non-natural substrates to be oxidised by a P450BM3
variant.118 With b-ionone (which is an important ﬂoral scent
component in its own right), allylic oxidation was strongly
favoured over other pathways, as with many terpenoids,
and product distributions were diﬃcult to manipulate, most
variants giving >95% 4-hydroxy-b-ionone.295 However, coupling
and activity were both enhanced relative to WT, and some
variants showed improved enantioselectivity. Variants were
found to discriminate surprisingly cleanly between diﬀerent
forms of geranylacetone, oxidising the Z-isomers to mixtures
of products that included allylic alcohols, but epoxidising the
E-isomers with high levels of regio- and enantio-speciﬁcity.302
Farnesol has been oxidised to o-hydroxyfarnesol, the primary
CYP4C7 metabolite, by variants that also oxidised geraniol
and geranylgeraniol, and a methyl ester derivative to 10,11epoxymethylfarnesoate, a juvenile hormone.32,115,324 Fig. 7 shows
the substrates in this category on which research has been carried
out, many of which are also oxidised by CYP102A7.143
The oxidation of (+)-valencene to nootkatone, a highly prized
grapefruit ﬂavouring not produced by WT, has attracted
considerable interest.154,300,387 Part of the awkwardness of this
challenge is the readiness with which nootkatone is itself accepted

as a substrate by P450BM3 variants. Nootkatone production was
ﬁrst achieved by deploying mutations F87A and I263A.300
Three A328I-containing mutants that gave Z 90% nootkatol/
nootkatone were subsequently identiﬁed by screening a library of
variants combining mutations at two speciﬁc residues—Ala328
in the inﬂuential SRS5 region and Phe87 in SRS1.154,381 This was
a vindication for the engineering strategy, since the stand-alone
A328I mutant was inactive towards (+)-valencene. A TTN of
5750 has been reported for limonene oxidation.387 (R)-8,9-limonene epoxide accounted for 95% of the products formed by
(R)-limonene when oxidised by A328F-containing variants
(vs. 7% for WT),154 but biasing selectivity in favour of the more
desirable potential end-products (carveol, carvone and perillyl
alcohol) proved more challenging, and for several years P450BM3
engineers viewed the 100% yields of (+)-trans-carveol414 and
(+)-perillyl alcohol415 achieved using other bacterial P450s with
some envy. Within the past few months, however, 97% perillyl
alcohol formation has been demonstrated using the A264V/
A328V/L437F triple mutant.274
6.3

Aliphatic hydrocarbons

6.3.1 Alkanes. Enzymes capable of alkane oxidation occur
naturally, examples being the terminal alkane hydroxylases
from Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus,
the membrane-bound non-haem iron alkane monooxygenase
AlkB, and methane monooxygenase (MMO).416,417 Numerous
bacterial, yeast and mammalian fatty acid hydroxylase
systems are also active towards alkyl hydrocarbons21—indeed,
B. megaterium hydroxylates a range of alkanes and cycloalkanes in vivo.418 AlkB is used to produce 1-octanol from
octane on an industrial scale, and variants with modestly
improved activity towards butane and propane have been
engineered.419 Like MMO, however, this enzyme is diﬃcult
to express in a robust form capable of biotransformation over
extended periods in a heterologous host. Similar considerations apply to CYP153A6.419 Potential applications for other
engineered P450s therefore exist in this ﬁeld, most notably in
the oxidation of methane. The development of a viable process
for the conversion of this freely available and underutilised
natural resource to methanol would be of enormous signiﬁcance, transforming a biogenic greenhouse gas at least twenty
times as potent as CO2 into a readily transportable fuel additive.

Researchers have approached the task by developing
variants capable of oxidising medium-chain alkanes, before
further engineering these to accept progressively shorter-chain
analogues. Hexane and octane were among the earliest nonnatural substrates to display NADPH consumption rates that
exceeded the leak rate with the wild-type enzyme.420 Octane
gave the highest NADPH consumption rate of the non-natural
substrates employed to assay the GVQ variant (29 s1),118 and
also its CYP102A3 equivalent.139 3-Methylpentane was readily
accepted by engineered variants, the R47L/Y51F/I401P triple
mutant giving a PFR of 50 s1.126 Propane hydroxylation
at >7 s1 was accomplished using a directed-evolution strategy,387
and also by a variant in which three of the four component
mutations were site-directed.126 However, the optimum oxidation rate reported for ethane was three orders of magnitude
lower,320 illustrating the severity of the engineering challenge
presented by smaller substrates.
Methane oxidation was ﬁnally reported earlier this year—
surprisingly, perhaps, by the wild-type enzyme rather than an
engineered variant.251 The experimental protocol contained two
key components: a pressurised system to raise substrate saturation levels, and the participation of a perﬂuorocarboxylic acid
co-substrate, a tightly binding but chemically inert ‘‘ﬁller’’ of the
type used by earlier researchers to expedite bilirubin metabolism.405 Oxidase activity towards longer-chain alkanes such as
butane was similarly improved, though diﬀerent substrates
showed diﬀerent co-substrate chain-length preferences.251,421
MD simulations suggested that the strategy succeeded partly
because the eﬀective volume of the access channel was reduced,
and partly through induction of the SB conformation of the
enzyme, including the displacement of the axial water molecule.251 Such co-substrates could also help to ﬂush the products
from non-natural substrate oxidation out of the active site,
freeing up the enzyme for the next round of catalysis (as discussed
in section 3.3, it is currently unclear how this is accomplished). It
is worth noting in this context that coupling in the oxidation of a
selection of ﬂuorinated octanes by a P450BM3 variant was
signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than in octane oxidation.353 It was
suggested that this could be due to ﬂuorine-porphyrin interactions, but it seems equally possible that the bulky substitutions
helped the substrate to bind more tightly in the active site.
Cyclohexane was reported as showing no activity,63 though
later researchers disagreed.124,237 Selectivity has been
redirected in the oxidation a substituted cyclohexane.274
Mutant A328V is more active than WT towards cyclooctane
and cyclodecane, but inactive towards cyclododecane unless
combined with the F87A mutation.339
6.3.2 Alkenes and alkynes. Like terpenes, alkenes typically
give product mixtures dominated by allylic alcohols and
epoxides when oxidised. The epoxides can be useful chiral
intermediates in the synthesis of cosmetics, surfactants,
industrial sterilants, and fumigants. Allylic alcohols can also
be desirable end-products, particularly those formed by
terminal alkenes—1-octen-3-ol, an aroma component and
insect attractant also known as mushroom alcohol, being an
example. Microsomal P450s are poisoned by terminal alkenes
such as 1-octene (though not by styrenes), possibly as a result of
N-alkylation of the porphyrin system and/or peptide

modiﬁcation during epoxidation.422 P450BM3 is noticeably less
prone to inactivation, probably because the allylic hydroxylation pathway competes relatively eﬀectively against the
epoxidation pathway, with which inactivation is associated.321
WT gave ca. 85% 1-octen-3-ol from 1-octene, for example, with
o5% epoxidation,355 in line with the 1-hexene product
distribution.321 This behaviour reﬂects the contrasting selectivity
preferences shown by the two enzyme types in the oxidation
of o-unsaturated fatty acids: P450BM3 favours allylic hydroxylation, while microsomal P450s typically epoxidise the terminal oleﬁnic linkage.26 Variant 139-3 gave 100% 1-hexen-3-ol
from 1-hexene at an initial NADPH consumption rate of 22 s1
in an investigation that also took in cyclohexene and propylene.380 Variants capable of 95% terminal epoxidation with
C5–C8 alkenes at ca. 75% ee have been developed.321 However,
these displayed lower initial NADPH consumption rates
(o3 s1), and inactivation was a severe hazard. TTNs of up
to 1350 were achieved, as against 200 for WT, but the same
variants gave TTNs of up to 14 000 for styrene epoxidation.
As with terminal oleﬁns, the oxidation of terminal acetylenes by P450BM3 took place adjacent to, rather than at, the
unsaturated linkage, where the opposite occurred with microsomal P450s.26 Inhibition was apparent with the C18
congener, though not with the C11 analogue.26,329 With
hexyne and octyne, inactivation was observed when the
unsaturated linkage was sub-terminal but not when it was
terminal.343 With F87G, inactivation occurred irrespective of
the location of the triple bond.

Aromatics

Fig. 8 shows the aromatic substrates that have been targeted
by P450BM3 engineers. Several of these constitute environmental and human health hazards on account of their
resistance to degradation, including beˆtes noires such as polychlorinated dioxins and PAHs. The monooxygenation of such
compounds is a potential method of remediation as the
accompanying solubility increase allows indigenous soildwelling bacteria to take up the metabolites and complete
the catabolic process (typically via dioxygenation). Highactivity variants are generally employed, with enlarged active
sites also being an important prerequisite for eﬃcient oxidation if bulky substrates are involved.249,375,377 The oxidation of
indole has been studied as a possible synthetic pathway to
indigo and indirubin.319,349 Numerous single-ring aromatic
compounds have been investigated. Styrene and p-chlorostyrene
were the ﬁrst to be identiﬁed as viable substrates for the
enzyme.423 m-Chlorostyrene was also readily accepted for
oxidation, as was propylbenzene.334 Styrenes, which are
converted to epoxides rather than aldehydes,423 have been
used to assay for epoxygenase activity.325,379 Alkylbenzenes
not containing a heteroatom are relatively eﬃciently oxidised,
particularly if the R47L/Y51F double substitution is
employed, and can be used as mechanistic probes.254,305,337
Mutations that promote aromatic hydroxylation over benzylic
hydroxylation are known,194,303 with potential applications
that include the production of catechols and pharmaceutical
precursors.424 Phenol formation via O-dealkylation is relatively
facile, a reaction ﬁrst probed using 11-phenoxyundecanoic acid.425

7.1

Production-scale approaches72,75,429,430
In vivo biotransformation

On the basis of its unusually high activity levels, self-suﬃciency,
solubility and amenability to engineering strategies that facilitate
non-natural substrate oxidation, P450BM3 is widely perceived to
be the most promising member of the P450 superfamily for
harnessing into production-scale applications. Like other isoforms, however, the enzyme is pyridine nucleotide-dependent,
requiring the expensive co-factor NADPH to function.
Numerous methods of sidestepping this obstacle have been
explored.431–433 The most prominent is in vivo biotransformation
(whole-cell oxidation), where the onus of co-factor production is
transferred to the host organism. While this neatly addresses the
cost issue, it introduces a number of separate challenges, one
of the more awkward being the eﬃcient mass transport of
substrates to the point of oxidation.298 Many organic
compounds do not readily cross cell membranes,434,435 sesquiterpenes being particularly recalcitrant. Counterstrategies
include adding permeability-enhancing agents such as
EDTA,333 partial lysis of the host,120 and engineering mutant
host strains with greater membrane permeability.436 Alternatively, the protein can be displayed on the cell surface,437 though
this cuts oﬀ the supply of NADPH, to which the membrane is
also non-permeable. Certain substrates are insoluble, and
others too volatile to remain for any length of time in
vigorously agitated bacterial growths. Some are harmful to the
host,364 making it diﬃcult to keep cultures viable and productive
for longer than 48 h,304 while reaction products typically represent
an even greater threat, being more water-soluble.
One method of mitigating cytotoxicity is to include a benign
organic phase into which the reaction components can partition. Long chain alkanes, which are essentially immune to
oxidation even by active P450BM3 variants, have been used in
this role,300 as have esters such as diisononyl phthalate,366
which oﬀer an element of polarity. The biotransformation of
cyclohexane has been carried out with the substrate forming its
own second phase, a protocol in which the culture remained
productive for at least 100 h.237 However, this approach is
generally too stressful for the host, activity ceasing after as
little as 1.5 h in the oxidation of ()-a-pinene, for example.364
This journal is

The presence of a second phase can also combat the adverse
eﬀects of high product concentrations on enzyme/substrate
saturation levels. To illustrate, the apparent KM for 12-pNCA
oxidation was found to be an order of magnitude higher when
determined in the presence of 1 mM ()-a-pinene oxidation
products.364 Biphasic systems can also be employed in vitro,
though they do not always emulate the performance of
monophasic systems.298 An alternative tactic is to vary the
host system. Two metabolites generated during the biotransformation of diclofenac proved to be no impediment to
cell growth in yeast, for example.374
Research has been undertaken to optimise fermenter-scale
bacterial growth conditions and protein expression levels.438,439
The dissolved oxygen concentration has an important bearing
on outcomes.440 Insuﬃcient oxygenation reduces the longevity
and productivity of cultures, but oxygen limitation can be used
as a means of suppressing the further oxidation of target
products,60 which frequently hampers biotransformation. A
balance therefore needs to be struck. Variants with enhanced
activity proﬁles can compromise the metabolic pathways of
the expression host by oxidising critical biological intermediates.124 The productive lives of biotransformations
involving variants that possess high leak rates or couple
ineﬃciently also tend to be inferior,312 as the reactive oxygen
species that are generated cause oxidative stress. Yields of
ca. 90 mmol product min1 g1 cell dry weight (90 U g1 cdw)
were achieved over 1.5 h in a 300 mL fermenter using a variant
that showed >95% coupling with propane.312 For reference,
AlkB gave a rate of 30 U g1 cdw with 1-nonene over 5 h.
There is evidence to suggest that NADPH availability is yieldlimiting in vivo,304,364 an issue that can be addressed in E. coli
by overexpressing the zwf gene responsible for the generation of
NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway.357,441 Another
option is to employ knock-out mutants to suppress respiratory
and fermentative pathways that also utilise this co-factor.357 The
‘‘product-per-glucose’’ yields given by the propane hydroxylase
described above more than trebled as a result of such initiatives
even though speciﬁc activity levels were reduced by almost 50%.
7.2 Co-factor regeneration and switching
Enzymatic co-factor regeneration is a commonly used method
of supporting in vitro oxidation or supplementing NAD(P)H
production in vivo, where the limited generating capacity of the
host system can rapidly be overwhelmed. Dehydrogenases,
which are compatible with a broad range of P450 substrates
and also relatively robust, typically take the partnering
role. Systems driven by glucose-6-phosphate,10,24,32,114,286,287
glucose,345,364,366 isocitrate29,326,328,333,442 and formate237,298
have all been employed to support P450BM3 oxidation,
as has ethanol, using an alcohol dehydrogenase from
Thermoanaerobium brockii.321 In vivo indigo yields from
indole were enhanced almost 30-fold over 8 h when glucose
dehydrogenase was co-expressed with WT,443 while total
product yields in a 500-mL a-pinene biotransformation
involving a 5-mutation variant increased 4.5-fold to
320 U g1 cdw over 1.5 h.364 A deazaﬂavin-dependent regeneration system driven by a 100 W lamp has been developed.444
Product generation was slower than with other approaches,

but the benign conditions resulted in higher total turnover
numbers with respect to the P450 component.
P450BM3 has been engineered to accept NADH, which can
be sourced at a fraction of the cost of NADPH, as a surrogate
electron source.72,199,237,356,359 NADH-dependent variants are
suitable for in vivo applications as well as in vitro oxidation,
since NADH is produced in greater quantities by E. coli than
NADPH, and is thus less rapidly exhausted. Introduction
of the W1046A mutation produced an enzyme capable of
utilising either co-factor, though still roughly twice as eﬃcient
with respect to NADPH as to NADH.237,359 The homologous
substitution had earlier been used to bring about a comparable
switch in CPR,445 whose crystal structure showed the tryptophan side-chain of the naturally occurring residue lying
directly above, and parallel to, the FAD unit. The W1046S
mutant was ca. 2.5-fold more eﬃcient with respect to NADH
in cytochrome c reduction than the W1046A mutant,237 while
a W1046D variant was able to accept either co-factor.357
Mutations at other residues close to the NAD(P)H binding
site were also inﬂuential,72,356,357 the R966D/W1046S double
mutant giving the highest TTN so far reported for the enzyme
(66 700), despite displaying in vitro activity levels four times
lower than those of WT.298 This mutant was subsequently
shown to be capable of accepting electrons from biomimetic
co-factors as well as from NADH and NADPH.358 These
artiﬁcial electron sources could be regenerated using an organorhodium complex, the TTN being ca. 300.
In a variation on this theme, NADPH regeneration has been
accomplished using an NADH-dependent transhydrogenase
harnessed to a glycerol dehydrogenase NADH-regenerating
system.446 Not all hydrogenases are NADPH-dependent, of
course. G6PDH from yeast accepts only NADP+, but that
from Leuconostoc mesenteroides accepts both NAD+ and
NADP+.447 Formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) are NAD+dependent, but can be engineered to recycle NADP+—indeed,
CYP102A2 has been used to assay the performance of an
engineered FDH from Candida boidinii.447 The same applies to
phosphite dehydrogenases.
7.3

Peroxide-dependent oxidation and other approaches

More radical approaches circumvent the use of NAD(P)H
altogether. The most widely explored employs peroxide as
oxidant in place of the co-factor.96,332 High peroxide
concentrations force the peroxide shunt uncoupling pathway
(section 1.2) into reverse, enabling P450s to function in the
manner of peroxide-dependent enzymes such as CPO or
P450BSb. BMP is typically used in preference to the fulllength enzyme, usually with mutation F87A incorporated, as
this signiﬁcantly enhances performance, though F87G342 and
F87V238 are also eﬀective. Mutagenesis at other residues can
further improve both activity and stability.123,297,335,372
Organic peroxides such as cumene hydroperoxide or t-butyl
hydroperoxide may be used in lieu of hydrogen peroxide.
While more expensive, these can enhance activity, cumene
hydroperoxide raising the kcat value for WT with indole by
two orders of magnitude238—though, with other substrates,
activity was below that shown by hydrogen peroxide.332 The
enzyme is rapidly inactivated by peroxide, particularly in the
1252

Chem. Soc. Rev., 2012, 41, 1218–1260

presence of substrate,123,332 such that a TTN of just 1000 has been
reported for a highly customised variant with 12-pNCA335—
in addition to which, reaction rates are often slow.
Interest has been shown in driving P450 oxidation electrochemically, a ﬁeld that has been reviewed.448 Since the haem
iron is buried inside the protein to guard against electron
transfer from inadvertent sources, the principal challenge is to
design an eﬀective enzyme-electrode interface. Chemical
mediators such as cobalt sepulchrate can be used as electron
shuttles,442 and this approach continues to be used in the
spectroelectrochemical titrations carried out to determine
reduction potentials. However, conﬁning the protein at the
point of electron delivery oﬀers practical advantages for
commercial-scale applications. In P450BM3, the ﬁrst example
involved the deposition of WT onto a graphite electrode in a
multilayered ﬁlm, with cyclic voltammetry (CV) being used to
demonstrate electron transfer.449 Two reduction potentials
were observed for the full-length enzyme, one corresponding
to that shown by BMP when studied in isolation, and the other
to that shown by isolated BMR. The behaviour of the enzyme
under such conditions has been studied spectroscopically.450
Enhanced haem reduction rates were achieved by attaching
pyrene to the Q387C BMP mutant,354 Gln387 being the
residue to which earlier researchers had attached a ruthenium
complex as a means of eﬀecting haem reduction via photoexcitation.348 The reduction potentials of WT BMP and the
haem domain of a directed-evolution variant, 1-12G were
similar in the absence of CO, as determined by thin-ﬁlm CV,
but diverged when CO-bound, as did dioxygen reduction rates,
suggesting that the high catalytic activity of 1-12G could be
dioxygen binding-related.451 Substrate oxidation was not
observed, however, and this remained the case when BMP was
immobilised using an SDS ﬁlm.373 Research on P450cam had
suggested that ﬁlm-based electrochemical oxidation took place as
a result of peroxide generated by the P450-mediated reduction of
dioxygen activating the peroxide shunt pathway, but variant
5H6, which had been custom-designed for use in peroxidedependent oxidation, was also inactive under these conditions.373
CV signals tend to be dominated by the P420 component, where
present.452 Deconvolution of the electrochemical responses associated with particular system components may be possible using
more sophisticated voltammetric methods.453
Two instances of electrochemically-driven substrate oxidation have been reported, both involving electron transfer to the
haem iron via a protein intermediary. A BMP/ﬂavodoxin fusion
gave six times the level of p-nitrophenol oxidation as isolated
BMP when deposited on modiﬁed glassy carbon electrodes.427
This construct had shown superior electrochemical properties
to full-length P450BM3 in earlier work.230 Secondly, p-nitrophenolate formation was observed when a full-length enzyme
variant was trapped on a glassy carbon electrode in polypyrrole
and exposed to 12-pNCA.365 A signiﬁcant increase in the PFR
was achieved using a platinum electrode. Enzymes are generally
unstable when absorbed directly onto electrodes, but performance can be improved by employing more sophisticated
layering techniques.378 A BMP mutant has been immobilised
on a functionalised gold electrode.198
Other alternative electron sources for P450BM3 include
hydrosulphite,454 1,1 0 -dicarboxycobaltocene,455 and zinc

powder, with cobalt sepulchrate as mediator.331 Catalytic
activity was reduced by 80% relative to the NADPH-driven
system using the latter approach, but this compared favourably with electrochemically-driven systems, where activity was
at least 8-fold lower.431 Moreover, signiﬁcant reductions in KM
values led to activity improvements of up to 50% for
engineered variants over WT with NADPH.307 There was
some uncertainty as to whether electrons passed from FMN
to BMP in the usual fashion in this system.306
The enzyme displayed much enhanced stability (t12 = 29 days
at 25 1C vs. 2 days in glycerol-free buﬀer) when co-immobilised
with an engineered FDH in a gel matrix.318 A single-mutation
CYP102A2 variant was immobilised on sepharose, where it
proved ca. 80% as active as the free enzyme.145 Enzyme
leaching levels were signiﬁcantly reduced when the F87A
mutant of BMP was immobilised on a mesoporous molecular
sieve in which the pore sizes had been matched to the enzyme
size. Activity towards 12-pNCA was 20% lower than with the
free enzyme, but octane activity was twice as high.338

Summary, conclusions and outlook

Almost forty years have elapsed since the discovery of
P450BM3, a period during which it has become one of the
most intensively studied of all enzymes. Early researchers were
fascinated by the idiosyncratic mixture of speciﬁcity and
promiscuity that characterised its catalytic behaviour, and
eager to understand how the complexities of electron delivery
were managed in a multi-domain P450 system. Fatty acids
were invariably chosen as substrates in the investigations
carried out to delineate its properties, and mutagenesis was
undertaken only as a means of corroborating sequence
alignment-based predictions that particular residues played
important roles. Today, with the focus on ﬁnding and developing practical applications, it is rare to encounter new research
that involves neither mutagenesis nor non-natural substrates.
There is a widely shared hope that at least some of the
environmentally unfriendly oxidation technologies that
currently dominate the landscape can be superseded using
engineered P450BM3 variants. And yet it would be wrong to
regard the enzyme merely as a platform for commercial
enterprises, as it also serves as an excellent window onto
general aspects of P450 chemistry. Recent studies have reconﬁrmed its relevance and usefulness as a model for human and
other eukaryotic isoforms, and the prodigious range of substrates that it can be adapted to oxidise makes it almost unique
as a fundamental research probe in this context.
While the various engineering strategies employed to
accelerate non-natural substrate oxidation have diﬀered
conceptually and identiﬁed unique mutations, most of the
high-activity variants so far reported appear to be generic in
reach rather than substrate-speciﬁc. This is probably because
they either possess reshaped active sites that are easier to
saturate, or have altered tertiary structures in which extensive
substrate-induced conformational change is no longer a prerequisite for rapid inter-domain electron transfer. Only where
a mutation has a speciﬁc impact on the active site—constricting it suﬃciently to impede access for larger substrates or
altering polarity at a crucial residue, for example—is it

unlikely to be eﬀective across a broad range of substrates.
Indeed, it is tempting to speculate that the reason high-activity
variants of the type developed by protein engineers have not
evolved via natural selection is that the associated reduction
in substrate speciﬁcity is physiologically undesirable. In principle, it should be possible to develop variants with lower KM
values for non-natural substrates than those so far achieved,
but rendering the active site easier to saturate can compromise
substrate binding and thereby selectivity, so this is not an ideal
strategy for targeting higher catalytic eﬃciency. Seeking to
enhance kcat values by raising FMN-to-haem electron transfer
rates may be equally hazardous, however, since mutants with
elevated kf values more often than not show lower kcat values
than WT on the evidence to date. Future researchers may
therefore need to focus on identifying the other catalytic steps
that contribute to rate limitation in P450BM3, and then search
for methods of expediting them.
Regio- and stereo-selective control is proving more diﬃcult
for engineers to master, as a limited number of the residues in
the substrate pocket appear to possess signiﬁcant selectivityinﬂuencing powers. Few variants capable of materially altering
the product proﬁles given by WT have been reported that do
not involve the mutation of at least one of three speciﬁc
residues: Ala82, Phe87 and Ala328. The recent demonstration
that the introduction of just three mutations is suﬃcient
to bring about Z 95% perillyl alcohol formation from
(R)-limonene vs. r1% for WT is an important advance, but
it is possible that more radical engineering strategies will be
required to produce high yields of speciﬁc oxidation products
from other substrates. Chimeragenesis is starting to come of
age and will surely be pursued further. Another possible
approach would be to substitute proline, a conformationally
demanding residue, at structurally sensitive positions throughout the protein with the aim of reshaping the active-site
architecture. The remarkable proline mutations already
identiﬁed suggest that, although a high incidence of enzyme
misfolding would undoubtedly result, this could be an
acceptable trade-oﬀ. The tactics recently used to facilitate
methane oxidation may also have applications in this area,
since co-substrates such as perﬂuorolaurate could impact not
merely activity but also selectivity with certain substrates.
Much has been made of the enzyme’s suitability for use in
commercial-scale applications, and there is a growing incumbency on researchers to bring this potential to fruition.
Biotransformation remains the most promising prospect, and
recent advances such as the manipulation of the metabolic
pathways of host systems conﬁrm that progress continues to
be made. However, the space-time yields and overall productivity of cultures will need to be considerably extended if
process economics of the required magnitude are to be
achieved. New host systems may be needed, and there are
question marks over whether plasmids are suﬃciently robust
to fulﬁl the roles being demanded of them. Enhancing the
longevity of the enzyme is another area of opportunity—and
one that impinges on in vitro approaches as well as biotransformation. Total turnover numbers are limited by a range
of factors, including the stability of the variants employed,
intrinsic activity levels, and the response of the enzyme to
speciﬁc substrates over extended periods of turnover,

including the inhibition rates associated with each product.
Too little is currently known about exit channels and product
release—particularly as far as non-natural substrates are
concerned—and whether degradation is primarily denaturative
in origin, or attributable to co-factor loss, haem modiﬁcation or
other factors.
With recent crystal structures giving a clearer picture of the
mechanistic relevance of the conformational changes induced by
directed-evolution, an understanding of how such variants
enhance catalytic activity has ﬁnally begun to emerge. As more
structures are solved, the signiﬁcance of the various salt bridges
and even some of the more complicated hydrogen bonding
networks in the protein may come more sharply into focus,
though rigorous analysis will be required to elucidate their exact
roles. On the other hand, there is still no crystal structure for the
full-length protein, or for BMP bound with a substrate in a
productive conformation (i.e. with a C–H bond close to the haem
iron), bound with a non-natural substrate, or in the ferrous,
ferrous-oxy or ferrous-CO form. While the ﬁrst FMN-to-haem
electron transfer has been well studied, the second electron
transfer remains a closed book, and dioxygen activation is still
poorly understood. The complexities of palmitate binding at
physiological phosphate concentrations have only recently been
deciphered, reopening the debate about the physiological role of
the enzyme. Slowly, this fascinating protein is revealing its
secrets, but a great deal more remains to be learned.
