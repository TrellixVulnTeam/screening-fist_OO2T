Cysteamine has been shown to increase intracellular glutathione levels in cystinotic cells, thus restoring the altered redox state of the cells. Also increased rates of apoptosis in cystinotic cells, which are thought to be the result of increased caspase 3 and protein kinase Cε activity, is counteracted by Cysteamine administration. Cysteamine has antioxidant properties as a result of increasing glutathione production. Cysteamine is an excellent scavenger of OH and HOCl; it also reacts with H2O2. Cysteamine increases the production of several heat shock proteins (HSP), including the murine Hsp40. Cysteamine exerts a dose-dependent effect on the doxorubicin-induced death of cancer cells, measured in both HeLa cells and B16 cells, whereas Cysteamine treatment alone had no influence on cell survival. In addition, in a doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell line, the addition of Cysteamine to doxorubicin results in a dramatic increase in cell death [1].

Methimazole is an antithyroid drug, and part of the thioamide group. Like its counterpart propylthiouracil, a major side effect of treatment is agranulocytosis. Methimazole is a drug used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland begins to produce an excess of thyroid hormone. The drug may also be taken before thyroid surgery to lower thyroid hormone levels and minimize the effects of thyroid manipulation. Additionally, Methimazole is used in the veterinary setting to treat hyperthyroidism in cats.
Methimazole inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I-) to iodine (I0), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin, a necessary step in the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine. It does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes.

Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NO2 and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients. Not enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. The lack of niacin may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease which is caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins: niacin,vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D and vitamin A, and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition.
Niacin has been used for over 50 years to increase levels of HDL in the blood and has been found to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events modestly in a number of controlled human trials. Niacin cannot be directly converted to nicotinamide, but both compounds could be converted to and are precursors of NAD and NADP in vivo.Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and tryptophan (via quinoline acid) are co-factors for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzyme for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis.High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.",C6H5NO2,H2O: 15 mg/mL,Metabolic Disease,Launched,O=C(C1=CC=CN=C1)O

Flucytosine, or 5-fluorocytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine analogue, is a synthetic antimycotic drug. It is structurally related to the cytostatic fluorouracil and to floxuridine. It is available in oral and in some countries also in injectable form. A common brand name is Ancobon. Flucytosine was first synthesized in 1957 but its antifungal properties were discovered in 1964. The drug is dispensed in capsules of 250 mg and 500 mg strength. The injectable form is diluted in 250 mL saline solution to contain 2.5 g total (10 mg/mL). The solution is physically incompatible with other drugs including amphotericin B.
Flucytosine is well absorbed (75 to 90%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, but does not decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2 grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to peak level decreases with continued therapy. After 4 days peak levels are measured after 2 hours. The drug is eliminated renally. In normal patients flucytosine has reportedly a half-life of 2.5 to 6 hours. In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to cumulate in these patients. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100  g/ml. Serum levels in excess of 100 ug are associated with a higher incidence of side effects.

Target: Others
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis (especially odd chain fatty acids) and energy production. 
Vitamin B12 normally plays a significant role in the metabolism of every cell of the body, especially affecting the DNA synthesis and regulation but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production. However, many (though not all) of the effects of functions of B12 can be replaced by sufficient quantities of folic acid (vitamin B9), since B12 is used to regenerate folate in the body. Most vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms are actually folate deficiency symptoms, since they include all the effects of pernicious anemia and megaloblastosis, which are due to poor synthesis of DNA when the body does not have a proper supply of folic acid for the production of thymine due to methyl trapping. When sufficient folic acid is available, all known B12 related deficiency syndromes normalize, save those narrowly connected with the vitamin B12-dependent enzymes Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A mutase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), also known as methionine synthase; and the buildup of their respective substrates (methylmalonic acid, MMA) and homocysteine.Coenzyme B12's reactive C-Co bond participates in three main types of enzyme-catalyzed reactions [1, 2].",C63H88CoN14O14P,10 mM in DMSO,Metabolic Disease,Launched,N#[C-][Co+3]123([N]4=CN(C(OC(CO)C5OP6([O-])=O)C5O)C7=C4C=C(C)C(C)=C7)[N]8=C9C(CCC(N)=O)C(CC(N)=O)(C)C8(C)C(C(CC(N)=O)C%10(CCC(NCC(C)O6)=O)C)[N-]1C%10=C(C)C(C(CCC(N)=O)C%11(C)C)=[N]2C%11=CC%12=[N]3C(C(CC(N)=O)(C)C%12CCC(N)=O)=C9C

Target: XAO
Allopurinol (Zyloprim, and generics) is a drug used primarily to treat hyperuricemia (excess uric acid in blood plasma) and its complications, including chronic gout. It is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is administered orally. A common misconception is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, but this action is principally carried out by Aldehyde oxidase. The active metabolite of allopurinol is oxypurinol, which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to oxypurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxypurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18–30 hours. For this reason, oxypurinol is believed responsible for the majority of allopurinol's effect.
Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis.

Isoniazid is a prodrug and must be activated by a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme that in M. tuberculosis is called KatG [1]. KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase known as InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acid, required for the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug PA-824 [2, 3].

Levetiracetam is used to control some types of seizures in patients with epilepsy. This medicine cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to use it. The exact mechanism for levetiracetam is unknown. However, the drug binds to a synaptic vesicle protein, SV2A, which is believed to impede nerve conduction across synapses [1].
Levetiracetam (10-200 mg/kg), ibuprofen (12.5-100 mg/kg), celecoxib (3.75-30 mg/kg), paracetamol (50-200 mg/kg), caffeine (15-100 mg/kg), and 2-drug combinations of levetiracetam with analgesics/caffeine produced a significant, dose-dependent reduction of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Isobolographic analysis revealed that levetiracetam exerts a synergistic interaction with analgesics, with approximately 7-, 9-, and 11-fold reduction of doses of both drugs in combination of levetiracetam with paracetamol, celecoxib, and ibuprofen, respectively. Analysis of the log dose-response curves for levetiracetam (1-50 mg/kg) in the presence of caffeine (10 mg/kg) and levetiracetam applied alone also revealed a synergistic interaction.

The antithyroid drug 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) was shown to have an unexpectedly prolonged inhibitory effect on iodination in the thyroid glands of rats. Eighteen hours after injection of a relatively small dose, iodination in the thyroid remained inhibited by more than 90% [2]. PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I-) to iodine (I0), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4). PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes.

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic medication used particularly for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Metronidazole is an antibiotic, amebicide, and antiprotozoal.[1] It is the drug of choice for first episodes of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile infection [2]. Metronidazole, taken up by diffusion, is selectively absorbed by anaerobic bacteria and sensitive protozoa. Once taken up by anaerobes, it is non-enzymatically reduced by reacting with reduced ferredoxin, which is generated by pyruvate oxido-reductase. Many of the reduced nitroso intermediates will form sulfinamides and thioether linkages with cysteine-bearing enzymes, thereby deactivating these critical enzymes. As many as 150 separate enzymes are affected.In addition or alternatively, the metronidazole metabolites are taken up into bacterial DNA, and form unstable molecules. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria.[3]",C6H9N3O3,DMSO 35 mg/mL; Water <1 mg/mL,Infection,Launched,OCCN1C([N+]([O-])=O)=CN=C1C

Sulfanilamide shows IC50 of 286.8 μg/mL for recombinant S. cerevisiae strains with wild-type FOL1 genes, but the single mutation 55Trp to 55Ala or 57Pro to 57Ser within the putative active site of the fungal DHPS confers resistance to Sulfanilamide with IC50 of >800 μg/mL [2]. Administration of Sulfanilamide with the dosage of 100 mg/kg/day is effective in the prevention of P. carinii infection in the immunosuppressed rat model. When the dosage of sulfaguanidine and Sulfanilamide reduced to 10 mg/kg/day, breakthrough P. carinii infection occurs in the rats [3].",C6H8N2O2S,DMSO: ≥ 30 mg/mL,Infection,Launched,O=S(C1=CC=C(N)C=C1)(N)=O

Target: Others
Ascorbic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound with antioxidant properties. It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish. It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions. Ascorbic acid is one form (""vitamer"") of vitamin C. It was originally called L-hexuronic acid, but when it was found to have vitamin C activity in animals (""vitamin C"" being defined as a vitamin activity, not then a specific substance), the suggestion was made to rename L-hexuronic acid. The new name for L-hexuronic acid is derived from a- (meaning ""no"") and scorbutus (scurvy), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Because it is derived from glucose, many animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as part of their nutrition. Other vertebrates lacking the ability to produce ascorbic acid include other primates, guinea pigs, teleost fishes, bats, and birds, all of which require it as a dietary micronutrient (that is, a vitamin)
Chemically, there exists a D-ascorbic acid which does not occur in nature. It may be synthesized artificially. It has identical antioxidant properties to L-ascorbic acid, yet has far less vitamin C activity (although not quite zero). This fact is taken as evidence that the antioxidant properties of ascorbic acid are only a small part of its effective vitamin activity. Specifically, L-ascorbate is known to participate in many specific enzyme reactions which require the correct epimer (L-ascorbate and not D-ascorbate).",C6H8O6,H2O: ≥ 100 mg/mL,Metabolic Disease,Launched,OC([C@@]1([H])[C@H](CO)O)=C(O)C(O1)=O

Carbimazole is an effective thyroid hormone inhibitor under a class of drugs known as pro-drugs. It is considered a pro-drug because it converts to methimazole after being absorbed by the body, generating an antithyroid action that works against hyperthyroidism (excessive production of thyroid hormones) and thyrotoxicosis (inflammation of the thyroid gland) [1]. Methimazole prevents the thyroid peroxidase enzyme from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, hence reducing the production of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine) [2].
Carbimazole (CBZ) is one of the major drugs currently used for the treatment of Graves' disease. Experiments with [35S] CBZ in rats showed that the drug is so rapidly transformed to MMI after i.v. injection (within 3 min) that very little of the unchanged drug would be expected to reach the thyroid gland. The antithyroid action of CBZ in rats, therefore, can be ascribed entirely to the MMI to which it is rapidly converted [3].",C7H10N2O2S,10 mM in DMSO,Endocrinology,Launched,O=C(N1C=CN(C)C1=S)OCC

Amantadine competes with protons for binding to the deprotonated tetramer, thereby stabilizing the tetramer in a slightly altered conformation.

In contrast to most other described channel-blocking molecules, amantadine causes the channel gate of NMDA receptors to close more quickly.

Dopamine (or 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neuroendocrine transmitter in the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays a number of important roles in the brain and bodies of humans. Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system. Outside the nervous system, dopamine functions in several parts of the body as a local chemical messenger. In the blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. A variety of important drugs work by altering the way the body makes or uses dopamine. Dopamine itself is available for intravenous injection: although it cannot reach the brain from the bloodstream, its peripheral effects make it useful in the treatment of heart failure or shock, especially in newborn babies. L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does reach the brain and is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease.

Hydralazine (apresoline) is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used to treat hypertension by acting as a vasodilator primarily in arteries and arterioles. By relaxing vascular smooth muscle, vasodilators act to decrease peripheral resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure and decreasing afterload. However, this only has a short term effect on blood pressure, as the system will reset to the previous, high blood pressure necessary to maintain pressure in the kidney necessary for natriuresis. The long term effect of antihypertensive drugs comes from their effects on the pressure natriuresis curve. It belongs to the hydrazinophthalazine class of drugs [1]. Hydralazine may reduce blood pressure when compared to placebo in patients with primary hypertension, however this data is based on before and after studies, not RCTs.

Target: Others
Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic drug that acts by inhibiting the ability of the patient to breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body. Miglitol inhibits glycoside hydrolase enzymes called alpha-glucosidases. Since miglitol works by preventing digestion of carbohydrates, it lowers the degree of postprandial hyperglycemia. It must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect. Its effect will depend on the amount of non-monosaccharide carbohydrates in a person's diet. Dietary supplementation with miglitol from pre-onset stage in OLETF rats delays the onset and development of diabetes and preserves the insulin secretory function of pancreatic islets [1].

Ciclopirox is a synthetic antifungal agent for topical dermatologic treatment of superficial mycoses. It is most useful against Tinea versicolor. The mechanism of action of ciclopirox is poorly understood [1]. However, loss of function of certain catalase and peroxidase enzymes has been implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism. In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation of the effects of both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport [2]. It acts by inhibiting the membrane transfer system by interrupting the Na+ K+ ATPase [1]. It is currently being investigated as an alternative treatment to ketoconazole for seborrhoeic dermatitis as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur.

in vivo:  Gabapentin produced an anti-allodynic effect over the 7-day period, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but increasing the expression of IL-10 (TNF-α, 316.0 ± 69.7 pg/mL vs 88.8 ± 24.4 pg/mL; IL-1β, 1,212.9 ± 104.5 vs 577.4 ± 97.1 pg/mL; IL-6, 254.0 ± 64.8 pg/mL vs 125.5 ± 44.1 pg/mL; IL-10, 532.1 ± 78.7 pg/mL vs 918.9 ± 63.1 pg/mL). The suppressive effect of gabapentin on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was partially blocked by the anti-IL-10 antibody [4].
Toxicity:  No new safety signals or adverse event trends relating to GEn exposure were identified [5].

Target: Histamine Receptor
Betahistine, a structural analogue of histamine with weak histamine H(1) receptor agonist and more potent H(3) receptor antagonist properties. Betahistine acts centrally by enhancing histamine synthesis within tuberomammillary nuclei of the posterior hypothalamus and histamine release within vestibular nuclei through antagonism of H(3) autoreceptors [1].
Therapeutic effects of betahistine in vestibular disorders result from its antagonist properties at histamine H(3) receptors (H(3)Rs). On inhibition of cAMP formation and [(3)H]arachidonic acid release, betahistine behaved as a nanomolar inverse agonist and a micromolar agonist. After acute oral administration, Betahistine increased t-MeHA levels with an ED(50) of 2 mg/kg, a rightward shift probably caused by almost complete first-pass metabolism. Therapeutic effects of betahistine result from an enhancement of histamine neuron activity induced by inverse agonism at H(3) autoreceptors [2].",C8H14Cl2N2,10 mM in DMSO,Neurological Disease,Launched,CNCCC1=CC=CC=N1.Cl.Cl

Minoxidil, a potent antihypertensive agent, induces generalized hypertrichosis when administered systemically, or localized hair regrowth when applied topically to sites of severe alopecia areata. The pharmacologic mechanisms by which minoxidil stimulates hair growth are unknown. This study was designed to examine whether minoxidil has direct effects on neonatal murine epidermal cells in culture. In the presence of minoxidil, cultures showed a marked dose-dependent second peak of DNA synthesis 8-10 days after culture initiation. In addition, two morphologically distinct cell types appeared. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with keratin-specific antibody revealed cytoplasmic keratin fibers, suggesting the epidermal origin of these cells. Our experiments demonstrate that minoxidil can affect epidermal cells in culture by altering their growth pattern and phenotypic appearance [1] . Finite doses of minoxidil (2%, w/v) in formulations containing varying amounts of ethanol, propylene glycol (PG), and water (60:20:20, 80:20:0, and 0:80:20 by volume, respectively) were used. Minoxidil in SC (by tape stripping), appendages (by cyanoacrylate casting), and receptor fluid was determined by liquid scintillation counting. At early times (30 min, 2 h), ethanol-containing formulations (60:20:20 and 80:20:0) caused significantly greater minoxidil retention in SC and appendages, compared to the formulation lacking ethanol (0:80:20). A significant increase in minoxidil receptor penetration occurred with the PG-rich 0:80:20 formulation after 12 h [2].",C9H15N5O,DMSO: 4.6 mg/mL (Need ultrasonic and warming),Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,NC1=NC(N2CCCCC2)=CC(N)=[N+]1[O-]

Arginine is an α-amino acid. It was first isolated in 1886. The L-form is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids. At the level of molecular genetics, in the structure of the messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA, CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG, are the triplets of nucleotide bases or codons that code for arginine during protein synthesis. In mammals, arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual.
L-Arginine is associated with a decrease in cardiac index while stroke index is maintained in patients with severe sepsis. Resolution of shock at 72 hours is achieved by 40% and 24% of the patients in the L-Arginine and placebo cohorts, respectively. L-Arginine (450 mg/kg during a 15-minute period) amplifies and sustains the hyperemia (38%) and increases absolute brain blood flow after eNOS upregulation by chronic simvastatin treatment (2 mg/kg subcutaneously, daily for 14 days) in SV-129 mice.",C6H15ClN4O2,H2O: ≥ 100 mg/mL,Others,Launched,N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=N)C(O)=O.[H]Cl

Nicorandil is a vasodilatory drug used to treat angina. Nicorandil stimulates guanylate cyclase to increase formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG) which phosphorylates and inhibits GTPase RhoA and decreases Rho-kinase activity. Reduced Rho-kinase activity permits an increase in myosin phosphatase activity, decreasing the calcium sensitivity of the smooth muscle. PKG also activates the sarcolemma calcium pump to remove activating calcium. PKG acts on K+ channels to promote K+ efflux and the ensuing hyperpolarization inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels. Overall, this leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and coronary vasodilation [1, 2].",C8H9N3O4,DMSO: ≥ 33 mg/mL,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,O=C(C1=CC=CN=C1)NCCO[N+]([O-])=O

Prilocaine is a local anesthetic of the amino amide type. In its injectable form (trade name Citanest), it is often used in dentistry. It is also often combined with lidocaine as a preparation for dermal anesthesia, for treatment of conditions like paresthesia. As it has low cardiac toxicity, it is commonly used for intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA). In some patients, a metabolite of prilocaine may cause the unusual side effect of methemoglobinemia, which may be treated with methylene blue. Maximum dosage for dental use: 8.0 mg/kg (2.7 mg/lb), with a maximum dose of 500 mg.
Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) containing 5% lidocaine and prilocaine in a cream was found to give effective topical analgesia in normal and diseased skin, making it useful for superficial surgery and various other clinical procedures.

Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid family. Nabumetone itself is non-acidic and, following absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite (6-MNA) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially COX-2 [1].
Nabumetone displays acute anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan-induced oedema model in rats and the ultraviolet-induced erythema model in guinea-pigs. Its activity in these tests is greater than that of aspirin but less than that of naproxen and indomethacin. In the cotton pellet-induced granuloma model in the rat, Nabumetone is active and produces no signs of toxicity at doses much greater than the lowest effective dose, unlike aspirin, naproxen or indomethacin.

Ibudilast (3-isobutyryl-2-isopropylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine) is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE). The inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilatation by ibudilast may be due to synergistic elevation of intracellular cyclic nucleotides and release of nitric oxide (NO) or prostacyclin from endothelium, rather than direct inhibition of PDE5 or PDE3. Another important property of ibudilast is its antiinflammatory activity possibly associated with potent inhibition of PDE4. Combined with its relaxing effects on bronchial smooth muscle, antiinflammatory actvity of ibudilast could favorably influence pathophysiology of asthma by antagonizing chemical mediators triggering asthmatic attacks [1, 2]. Ibudilast (AV-411) is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that is also known to suppress glial cell activation. Preclinical data indicate that ibudilast crosses the blood-brain barrier, is well tolerated, is active on oral administration, reduces glial activation and attenuates pain symptoms in diverse rat models of neuropathic pain.

Methyldopa is an alpha-adrenergic agonist (selective for α2-adrenergic receptors) psychoactive drug used as a sympatholytic or antihypertensive. Its use is now mostly deprecated following the introduction of alternative safer classes of agents. However, it continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)).
Methyldopa has a dual mechanism of action. It is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase, also known as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which converts L-DOPA into dopamine. Dopamine is a precursor for norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and subsequently epinephrine (adrenaline). This inhibition results in reduced dopaminergic and adrenergic neurotransmission in the peripheral nervous system. This effect may lower blood pressure and cause central nervous system effects such as depression, anxiety, apathy, anhedonia, and parkinsonism. It is converted to α-methylnorepinephrine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). α-methylnorepinephrine is an agonist of presynaptic central nervous system α2-adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors in the brainstem appears to inhibit sympathetic nervous system output and lower blood pressure.

Target: Nucleoside antimetabolite/analog
Cytidine is a nucleoside molecule that is formed when cytosine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a component of RNA. If cytosine is attached to a deoxyribose ring, it is known as a deoxycytidine. Dietary sources of cytidine include foods with high RNA (ribonucleic acid) content, such as organ meats, Brewer's yeast, as well as pyrimidine-rich foods such as beer. During digestion, RNA-rich foods are broken-down into ribosyl pyrimidines (cytidine and uridine), which are absorbed intact. In humans, dietary cytidine is converted into uridine, which is probably the compound behind cytidine's metabolic effects.
There are a variety of cytidine analogs with potentially useful pharmacology.

Doxifluridine is a fluoropyrimidine derivative and oral prodrug of the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with antitumor activity. Doxifluridine, designed to circumvent the rapid degradation of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in the gut wall, is converted into 5-FU in the presence of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis and subsequent cell division by reducing normal thymidine production and interferes with RNA transcription by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand.
in vitro: 5'-DFUR's metabolic product(N3-Me-5'-dFUR) was found to be non-toxic in all the cell growth experiments performed. The absence of cytotoxicity could be explained by the observation that the metabolite was not recognized as a substrate by thymidine phosphorilase, the enzyme responsible for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) release from doxifluridine, as ascertained by high-performance liquid chromatography/ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) analysis of the incubation mixture[1].

Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole active in vitro against a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Tinidazole is an effective treatment against anaerobic microorganisms based on its pharmacokinetic characteristics (C(max) 51 microg/ml, t(1/2) 12.5 h) and its excellent in vitro activity. Its long half-life allows once a day regimens. Tinidazole is as effective as metronidazole in the treatment of infections caused by T. vaginalis, giardiasis and amebiasis and bacterial vaginosis, malaria, odontogenic infections, anaerobic bacterial infections (pelvic inflammatory disease, diabetic foot), surgical prophylaxis (abdominal and hysterectomy) and Helicobacter pylori eradication. 
Tinidazole has recently been resurrected and FDA approved for trichomoniasis and BV in the USA and is being restudied as an alternative to metronidazole for BV.

Based on these susceptibility levels, 73 and 68 of 96 fresh clinical isolates were susceptible to pyrimethamine (mean IC50 15.4 nM) and cycloguanil (mean IC50 11.1 nM), respectively [1]. We tested pyrimethamine(previously reported to suppress SOD1 expression), several compounds currently in trials in human and murine ALS, and a set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds. In a PC12 cell-based assay, no compounds reduced SOD1 promoter activity without concomitant cytotoxicity. Additionally,pyrimethamine failed to repress levels of SOD1 protein in HeLa cells or homogenates of liver, spinal cord and brain of wild-type mice [3].
in vivo: (131)I-Pyrimethamine (specific activity: 7.08 MBq/ mol) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the control and infected rats.

Target: Sodium Channel
Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug. It is useful to treat partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures but not primary generalized seizures such as absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Phenytoin is believed to protect against seizures by causing voltage-dependent block of voltage-gated sodium channels [1]. Phenytoin has low affinity for resting sodium channels at hyperpolarized membrane potentials [2]. When neurons are depolarized and the channels transition into the open and inactivated states, greater binding and block occur. The inhibitory potency is strongly use dependent, so that block accumulates with prolonged or repetitive activation, such as occurs during a seizure discharge. The blocking of sodium channels by phenytoin is of slow onset. The time course of fast sodium currents is therefore not altered in the presence of the drug and action potentials evoked by synaptic depolarizations of ordinary duration are not blocked. Thus phenytoin is able to selectively inhibit pathological hyperexcitability in epilepsy without unduly impairing ongoing activity. Phenytoin also blocks persistent sodium current and this may be of particular importance in seizure control. Phenytoin is a class 1b antiarrhythmic [3].",C15H12N2O2,10 mM in DMSO,Neurological Disease,Launched,O=C1NC(C(C2=CC=CC=C2)(C3=CC=CC=C3)N1)=O

Target: Sodium Channel
Lamotrigine stabilises presynaptic neuronal membranes by blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels, thus preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate and aspartate [1]. In rat cerebral cortex tissue incubated with veratrine 10 mg/L, lamotrigine is twice as potent in inhibiting the release of glutamate and aspartate (ED 50 = 5.38 mg/L for each) than the release of GABA (ED50 = 11.2 mg/L), and is much less potent in inhibiting acetylcholine release (ED50 = 25.6 mg/L) when cortical slices is exposed to veratrine 75 mg/L. Basal glutamate release is unaffected [2].  Lamotrigine inhibits high-frequency sustained repetitive firing of sodium-dependent action potentials, indicating a direct effect on voltage-activated sodium channels [3]. Lamotrigine (Lamictal), a phenyltriazine derivative, is a well established anticonvulsant agent that has shown efficacy in the prevention of mood episodes in adult patients with bipolar I disorder. lamotrigine significantly delayed time to intervention for a depressive episode and showed limited efficacy in delaying time to intervention for a manic/hypomanic episode, compared with placebo.

Pyridostigmine is a parasympathomimetic and a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. Since it is a quaternary amine, it is poorly absorbed in the gut and does not cross the blood–brain barrier, except possibly in stressful conditions.

It is a quaternary carbamate inhibitor of cholinesterase that does not cross the blood–brain barrier which carbamylates about 30% of peripheral cholinesterase enzyme. The carbamylated enzyme eventually regenerates by natural hydrolysis and excess ACh levels revert to normal.
Pyridostigmine is used to treat muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis and to combat the effects of curariform drug toxicity.

Adenosine plays an important role in biochemical processes, such as energy transfer — as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) — as well as in signal transduction as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP. It is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter, believed to play a role in promoting sleep and suppressing arousal. Adenosine also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation.
Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes. Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g. in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600–1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity.

Rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-(R)-aminoindan) is a novel, highly potent irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, anti-Parkinsonian drug. Rasagiline is effective as monotherapy or adjunct to L-Dopa for patients with early and late Parkinson's disease (PD) [1]. Rasagiline inhibits MAO-B more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. In several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive therapy in advanced PD. In addition, rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. The recently completed delayed-start ADAGIO (Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect Given Once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for rasagiline 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established [2].

Lidocaine is approximately 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically-active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half life than lidocaine but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The elimination half-life of lidocaine is approximately 90–120 minutes in most patients.

Target: Sodium Channel
Phenytoin sodium is an antiepileptic drug. It is useful to treat partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures but not primary generalized seizures such as absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Phenytoin is believed to protect against seizures by causing voltage-dependent block of voltage-gated sodium channels [1]. Phenytoin has low affinity for resting sodium channels at hyperpolarized membrane potentials [2]. When neurons are depolarized and the channels transition into the open and inactivated states, greater binding and block occur. The inhibitory potency is strongly use dependent, so that block accumulates with prolonged or repetitive activation, such as occurs during a seizure discharge. The blocking of sodium channels by phenytoin is of slow onset. The time course of fast sodium currents is therefore not altered in the presence of the drug and action potentials evoked by synaptic depolarizations of ordinary duration are not blocked. Thus phenytoin is able to selectively inhibit pathological hyperexcitability in epilepsy without unduly impairing ongoing activity. Phenytoin also blocks persistent sodium current and this may be of particular importance in seizure control. Phenytoin is a class 1b antiarrhythmic [3].",C15H11N2NaO2,DMSO: ≥ 34 mg/mL,Neurological Disease,Launched,[O-]C1=NC(C(C2=CC=CC=C2)(C3=CC=CC=C3)N1)=O.[Na+]

Ethambutol directly affects two polymers, arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in Mycobacterium smegmatis. In M. smegmatis, Ethambutol inhibits synthesis of arabinan completely and inhibits AG synthesis most likely as a consequence of this; more than 50% of the cell arabinan is released from the bacteria following Ethambutol treatment, whereas no galactan is released. Ethambutol main targets against embB gene product in M. avium. Ethambutol induces 60% changes in the embB gene in M. tuberculosis resistant mutants [1]. Ethambutol is effective against actively growing microorganisms of the genus Mycobacterium, including M. tuberculosis. Nearly all strains of M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii as well as a number of strains of the M. aviumcomplex (MAC) are sensitive to Ethambutol. [1] Ethambutol is potency against M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) with MIC of 0.5 μg/mL in vitro [2]. Ethambutol is efficient on treatment of mycobacterial-infected macrophages.

Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft.

It is used to treat the spasms, cramping, and tightness of muscles caused by medical problems such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, spastic diplegia, back pain, or certain other injuries to the spine or central nervous system. It is also prescribed off-label for migraine headaches, as a sleep aid, and as an anticonvulsant. It is also prescribed for some symptoms of fibromyalgia.
Tizanidine has been found to be as effective as other antispasmodic drugs and has superior tolerability to that of baclofen and diazepam. Tizanidine can be very strong even at the 2 mg dose and may cause hypotension, so caution is advised when it is used in patients who have a history of orthostatic hypotension, or when switching from gel cap to tablet form and vice versa.

Trimethoprim (TMP), an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, decreases the level of tetrahydrofolate supplying one-carbon units for biosynthesis of nucleotides, proteins, and panthotenate. TMP caused induction of DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, ClpB, and IbpA/B Hsps. Among these Hsps, IbpA/B were most efficiently induced by TMP and coaggregated with the insoluble proteins [1]. Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's affinity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is several thousand times greater than its affinity for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to their synergistic effects.

Pizotifen, is a benzocycloheptane based drug used as a medicine, primarily as a preventative to reduce the frequency of recurrent migraine headaches [1]. Pizotifen proved to be a highly selective 5-HT receptor blocking agent both in vivo (on saphenous veins) and in vitro (on saphenous veins and basilar arteries) from dogs and humans [2].
Three groups of pregnant mice were treated daily with oral doses (0.24, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg) of pipethiadene and pizotifen from day 4 to day 16 of gestation. The following parameters were investigated: reproductive health of the dams, external, skeletal and visceral malformations of fetuses and frequencies of micronuclei and chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells of dams. Oral administration of Pipethiadene or Pizotifen produced no teratogenic effects. However, the significant reduction of fetal weight after all doses of Pipethiadene or Pizotifen was found to correlate well with the decreased values of the mitotic indices of bone marrow cells of mice [3].

Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) taken or applied to reduce inflammation and as an analgesic reducing pain in certain conditions. The primary mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic action is thought to be inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). It also appears to exhibit bacteriostatic activity by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis. Inhibition of COX also decreases prostaglandins in the epithelium of the stomach, making it more sensitive to corrosion by gastric acid. This is also the main side effect of diclofenac.

Ticlopidine (trade name Ticlid) is an antiplatelet drug in the thienopyridine family. Ticlopidine hydrochloride inhibits platelet aggregation with IC50 of ~2 μM in men. Like clopidogrel, it is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor. It is used in patients in whom aspirin is not tolerated, or in whom dual antiplatelet therapy is desirable. Because it has been reported to increase the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and neutropenia, its use has largely been supplanted by the newer drug, clopidogrel, which is felt to have a much lower hematologic risk. Its niche role as an alternative in those patients who do not tolerate Clopidogrel has now been superdeded by Ticagrelor and Prasugrel. The usual dose is 250 mg twice daily by the oral route.
Ticlopidine hydrochloride, when orally administered to rats, results in activation of basal and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated adenylate cylase activity through increase in affinity of the cyclase in platelet membrane to PGE1, although it failed to affect adenosine- or sodium fluoride-stimulated activity of the enzyme.",C14H15Cl2NS,10 mM in DMSO,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,ClC1=CC=CC=C1CN2CCC3=C(C=CS3)C2.Cl

The new evidence-based European S3-guideline recommends the use of Isotretinoin as a first-line medication for the treatment of severe papulopustular or conglobate acne, especially when prognostically unfavorable factors are present: family history of acne, early onset, marked seborrhea, localization on the trunk, scarring, psychosocial disability or persistent/late-type acne [1]. Five patients with pityriasis rubra pilaris were treated with isotretinoin from September 1982 through 1985. Isotretinoin at an average dose of 1.16 mg/kg/day for 16 to 24 weeks caused complete or almost complete clearing in four of the five patients [2]. isotretinoin produces significant anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis across intact biologic barriers in vivo [3].

Mianserin is a psychoactive drug of the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) therapeutic family. It is classified as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) and has antidepressant, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), hypnotic (sedating), antiemetic (nausea and vomiting-attenuating), orexigenic (appetite-stimulating), and antihistamine effects. It is not approved for use in the US, but its analogue, mirtazapine, is. Mianserin was the first antidepressant to reach the UK market that was less dangerous than the tricyclic antidepressants in overdose.
Mianserin is an antagonist/inverse agonist of the H1, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, α1-adrenergic, and α2-adrenergic receptors, and also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. As a high affinity H1 receptor inverse agonist, mianserin has strong antihistamine effects (sedation, weight gain, etc.). Contrarily, it has negligible affinity for the mACh receptors, and thus lacks any anticholinergic properties. It was recently found to be a potent kappa opioid receptor agonist. In addition, mianserin also appears to be a potent antagonist of the neuronal octopamine receptor.

Risedronate sodium, which was promoted in Croatia a few months ago, is the latest (III) generation of bisphosphonates, the most efficient anti-resorption drugs that inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and change the bone metabolism. Risedronate sodium is hence the first line of bisphosphonates for the reduction of vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risks in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those with a high risk of osteoporosis. It also efficiently prevents bone loss or improves bone density in men and women on a long-term corticosteroid therapy [1].

On the seventh day of treatment the inhibitions were 63% and 88.9% with 20 and 25 mg/kg, respectively. After recovering the parasitemia, a dose-response curve was obtained for estimating the ID50 (dose causing 50% inhibition), equivalent to 17 ± 1.8 mg/kg after 7 days of treatment. Four days after the interruption of treatment (11 days postinfection), the parasitemias of the groups treated with 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/kg/day were 15.3%, 15.9%, 15.2%, and 5.7%, respectively.

Oral fluconazole was not associated with a significantly increased risk of birth defects overall or of 14 of the 15 specific birth defects of previous concern. Fluconazole exposure may confer an increased risk of tetralogy of Fallot [2]. Fluconazole is predicted to be ineffective against Cryptococcus gattii in the koala as a sole therapeutic agent administered at 10 mg/kg p.o. every 12 h [3].

Nitazoxanide is a synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative and an antiprotozoal agent. In vitro studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Marietta, GA) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS.
The anti-protozoal activity of nitazoxanide is believed to be due to interference with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme dependent electron transfer reaction which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. It has also been shown to have activity against influenza A virus in vitro. The mechanism appears to be by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion.

Bifonazole, a new broad-spectrum antimycotic, interferes with sterol biosynthesis. In dermatophytes bifonazole additionally inhibits directly HMG-CoA-reductase. bifonazole possesses a sequential mode of action, namely inhibition of cytochrome P450-dependent C14-demethylation of sterols and direct inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase. In vitro bifonazole shows a strongly pH-dependent efficacy. The uptake kinetics of bifonazole have been measured with different pathogens [1]. Bifonazole additionally leads to a generally decreased rate of sterol biosynthesis as compared to clotrimazole, due to a direct inhibition of microsomal HMG-CoA-reductase. The additional fungicidal effects of bifonazole are considered to originate from a sequential action by inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase and of cytochrome P450 [2]. bifonazole were affected by choice of medium with Kimmig's agar generally giving the lowest MIC's.

Gestodene is androgenically neutral, meaning that contraceptive pills containing gestodene do not exhibit the androgenic side effects (e.g. acne, hirsutism, weight gain) often associated with second-generation contraceptive pills, such as those containing levonorgestrel. When 40 micrograms of gestodene was taken, six out of seven women did not ovulate, and one out of seven had a cycle with luteal insufficiency. These data indicate that 40 micrograms of gestodene is the borderline dose for inhibition of ovulation. A combination of 75 micrograms gestodene with 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol was found to inhibit ovulation in ten subjects, and no follicular maturation was noted [1]. gestodene bound with high affinity to the progesterone receptor, as did other synthetic and natural progestogens.

Desloratadine (300 nM to 100 μM) inhibits both IgE and non-IgE-mediated histamine release from human peripheral blood basophils. Desloratadine (0.1 μM to 10 μM) is also shown to inhibit platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil chemotaxis and TNF-α-induced eosinophil adhesion in eosinophils obtained from patients with allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma [1]. Desloratadine (1 μM-10 μM) dose-dependently inhibits the release of histamine and LTC4 from human basophils. Desloratadine (0.1 μM-10 μM) dose-dependently inhibits IL-13 secretion from basophils activated with IL-3 and PMA from human basophils.

Amitriptyline acts primarily as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with strong actions on the serotonin transporter and moderate effects on the norepinephrine transporter. It has negligible influence on the dopamine transporter and therefore does not affect dopamine reuptake, being nearly 1,000 times weaker on it than on serotonin [1]. Amitriptyline additionally functions as a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, α1-adrenergic, H1, H2, and mACh receptorantagonist, and σ1 receptor agonist. It has also been shown to be a relatively weak NMDA receptor negative allosteric modulator at the same binding site as phencyclidine. Amitriptyline inhibits sodium channels, L-type calcium channels, and Kv1.1, Kv7.2, and Kv7.3 voltage-gated potassium channels, and therefore acts as a sodium, calcium, and potassium channel blocker as well [2]. Recently, amitriptyline has been demonstrated to act as an agonist of the TrkA and TrkB receptors.

Target: SNRI
Venlafaxine is an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class. First introduced by Wyeth in 1993, now marketed by Pfizer, it is licensed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, and comorbid indications in certain anxiety disorders with depression. In 2007, venlafaxine was the sixth most commonly prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 17.2 million prescriptions.
Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin and norepinephrine. Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, since dopamine is inactivated by norepinephrine reuptake in the frontal cortex. The frontal cortex largely lacks dopamine transporters; therefore, venlafaxine can increase dopamine neurotransmission in this part of the brain. Venlafaxine interacts with opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) as well as the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and was shown to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following intraperitoneal injection. These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as narcotics become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.",C17H28ClNO2,H2O: ≥ 35 mg/mL,Neurological Disease,Launched,OC1(C(C2=CC=C(OC)C=C2)CN(C)C)CCCCC1.Cl

Valdecoxib inhibits COX-1 in a competitive fashion only at very high concentrations (IC(50) = 150 microM). Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for the potency and in vitro selectivity of valdecoxib for COX-2. Valdecoxib showed similar activity in the human whole-blood COX assay (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.24 microM; COX-1 IC(50) = 21.9 microM) [1]. The affinity of [(3)H]celecoxib for COX-2 (K(D) = 2.3 nM) was similar to the affinity of [(3)H]valdecoxib (K(D) = 3.2 nM). The binding to COX-2 seems to be both rapid and slowly reversible with association rates of 5.8 x 10(6)/M/min and 4.5 x 10(6)/M/min and dissociation rates of 14 x 10(-3)/min (t(1/2) = 50 min) and 7.0 x 10(-3)/min (t(1/2) = 98 min) for [(3)H]celecoxib and [(3)H]valdecoxib, respectively [2].

In these same animals, COX-1 was spared at doses greater than 200 mg/kg [1]. Valdecoxib was extensively metabolized after a single 5 mg/kg oral administration of [(14)C]valdecoxib and elimination of unchanged drug was minor (less than 1%) in male and female mice [3].

Progesterone does not dissolve in water and is poorly absorbed when taken orally unless micronized in oil. Products are often sold as capsules containing micronised progesterone in oil. Progesterone can also be administered through vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, transdermally through a gel or cream, or via injection (though the latter has a short half-life requiring daily administration).

Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those na ve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound [1-3].",C19H27NO3,10 mM in DMSO,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,O=C(O)[C@@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC([C@H]2CC[C@H](C(C)C)CC2)=O

Mycophenolic acid(MPA) is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation. It inhibits an enzyme needed for the growth of T cells and B cells. MPA did not block the initial phase of viral translation but did interfere with viral protein synthesis in the amplification phase. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that MPA prevented the accumulation of viral positive- and negative-strand RNA as the infection proceeded. MPA inhibits flavivirus infection by preventing synthesis and accumulation of viral RNA [1]. The effects of mycophenolic acid (MPA) on DEN replication in monkey kidney (LLC-MK2) cells were examined.

Carbazochrome is an antihemorrhagic agent that will cease blood flow by causing the aggregation and adhesion of platelets in the blood to form a platelet plug, ceasing blood flow from an open wound. It is hoped that this drug can be used in the future for preventing excessive blood flow during surgical operations and the treatment of hemorrhoids. Carbazochrome interacts with α-adrenoreceptors on surface of platelets, which are coupled to Gq protein and initiate PLC IP3/DAG pathway to increase intracellular free calcium concentration with these subsequent actions. Activates PLA2 and induce arachidonic acid pathway to synthese endoperoxides (TxA2, thromboxane A2). Calcium binds to calmodulin which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase, that will enable the myosin crossbridge to bind to the actin filament and allow contraction to begin.

Once bound to the receptor, progestins like etonogestrel will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge [1].",C22H28O2,10 mM in DMSO,Endocrinology,Launched,CC[C@]([C@]1(O)C#C)(C2)[C@](CC1)([H])[C@@](CCC3=CC4=O)([H])[C@]([C@@]3([H])CC4)([H])C2=C

in vitro: Dimesna modulates paclitaxel-induced hyperpolymerization of MTP in a dose-dependent manner, and mesna, an in vivo metabolite of Dimesna, protects against time-dependent cisplatin-induced inactivation of MTP. [1] Dimesna -mediated prevention or mitigation of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may involve aminopeptidase N (APN) inhibition by certain Dimesna -derived esna-disulfide heteroconjugates and appears correlated to the presence of a glycinate moiety and/or an anionic group. Two general mechanisms for Dimesna -mediated nephroprotection of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity involving the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), APN and cysteine-conjugated-β-lyase (CCBL) nephrotoxigenic pathway are proposed which acting in a concerted and/or synergistic manner, and thereby prevent or mitigate cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. [2] Mesna and its dimer, Dimesna, are coadministered for mitigation of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities, respectively. Dimesna is selectively reduced to mesna in the kidney, producing its protective effects. In vitro screens of uptake and efflux transporters reveal renal organic anion transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OAT4 are responsible for kidney-specific uptake of Dimesna. Uptake of Dimesna by OAT1, OAT3, and OAT4 is determined to be saturable with KM of 636 μM, 390 μM and 590 μM, respectively. [3]

Target: RAR/RXR
Acitretin is a second-generation, systemic retinoid that has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis since 1997. It can be considered one of the treatments of choice for pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis. However, the efficacy of acitretin as a monotherapy for plaque psoriasis is less, although it is often used in combination therapy with other systemic psoriasis therapies, especially ultraviolet B or psoralen plus ultraviolet A phototherapy, to increase efficacy. Such combination treatments may potentially minimise toxicity by using lower doses of each of the two agent [1].
Thirty-nine male adult Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups as two experimental groups and one control group. The first group consisting 14 rats were applied orally standard dose (0.75 mg/kg/day) acitretin and the second group consisting 16 rats were applied high dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) acitretin.Acitretin was given within dimetil sulphoxide (DMSO), which was diluted with saline solution as a ratio of 1/10, in order to increase its solubility. The control group consisting 9 rats were given only saline solution including DMSO for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of the administration, half of the rats in the first and second groups and the entire control group were sacrificed under deep ether anaesthesia and bilateral orchiectomy was made. The remainingrats were compared with the control group using a similar method at the end of 8 weeks of wash-off period. The orchiectomy materials were histopathologically evaluated under the light microscope for spermatogenesis according to parameters including spermatogenetic activity, spermatogenetic organization, seminiferous tubular diameter, interstitial Leydig cells and fibroblasts.  In our study it was concluded that the standard and high doses of acitretin do not have any effect on the spermatogenesis of threats [2].

Furosemide (INN/BAN) or frusemide is a loop diuretic used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and edema. It is most commonly marketed by Sanofi under the brand name Lasix, and also under the brand names Fusid and Frumex. It has also been used to prevent Thoroughbred and Standardbred race horses from bleeding through the nose during races.Along with some other diuretics, furosemide is also included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned drug list due to its alleged use as a masking agent for other drugs.
Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting NKCC2, the luminal Na-K-2Cl symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance.Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. Furosemide has been reported to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at uM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors.

Esmolol hydrochloride competitively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in cardiac muscle and reduces the contractility and cardiac rate of heart muscle, thereby decreasing cardiac output and myocardial oxygen demands. This agent also decreases sympathetic output centrally and blocks renin secretion. At higher doses, Esmolol hydrochloride also blocks beta-2 receptors located in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, thereby leading to smooth muscle relaxation.",C16H26ClNO4,10 mM in DMSO,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,O=C(OC)CCC1=CC=C(OCC(O)CNC(C)C)C=C1.[H]Cl

Topiramate (Topamax) is a structurally novel broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) with established efficacy as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, partial seizures with or without generalised seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [1]. topiramate has been believed to be a type of antiepileptic drug that blocks spread of seizures. Thus far, the mechanisms of its actions have been proven to include use-dependent inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels in neurons, potentiation of GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid)-induced Cl- influx, and inhibitory effects on inward currents by antagonizing kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors [2].
Topiramate (median average dosage 5.1 mg/kg/day) was also found to be useful as adjunctive therapy in the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and significantly reduced the mean frequency of drop attacks by 14.8% compared with an increase of 5.1% with placebo. Further gains in seizure control were made in a nonblind extension of this trial where the mean topiramate dosage was 10 mg/kg/day.

Clotrimazole (brand name Canesten or Lotrimin) is an antifungal medication commonly used in the treatment of fungal infections (of both humans and other animals) such as vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, and ringworm. It is also used to treat athlete's foot and jock itch.It is commonly available as an over-the-counter substance in various dosage forms, such as a cream, and also (especially in the case of ear infection) as a combination medicine. It is also available as a troche or throat lozenge (prescription only). For ear infection, it is often applied in liquid form, as ear drops.
The antimycotic drug clotrimazole inhibits the function of the gastric H,K-ATPase in a manner similar to that observed for the Na,K-ATPase. Because of the high hydrophobicity of the compound, the interaction between clotrimazole and the ion pump occurs at the membrane domain in the apolar core of the membrane.

Target: H+/K+ ATPase
in vitro: TAK-438 is a pyrrole derivative with a chemical structure that is completely different from the P-CABs developed to date. TAK-438 inhibits gastric H+/K+ ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Under neutral conditions (pH 7.5), the inhibitory activity of TAK-438 is almost the same as that under weakly acidic conditions (pH 6.5). TAK-438 does not inhibit Na+/K+ ATPase activity even at concentration 500 times higher than their IC50 values against gastric H+/K+ ATPase activity. TAK-438 inhibits gastric H+/K+ ATPase in a K+ competitive manner with Ki of 3 nM [2]. 
in vivo: TAK-438 inhibits basal gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner, and the ID50 value is 1.26 mg/kg. Intravenous administration of TAK-438 dose-dependently increases the pH of the gastric perfusate, and the increase in pH is sustained for 5 h after administration. At the 1 mg/kg dose, the pH plateaues 90 min after administration, and the highest pH value reached is 5.9 [2]. In addition, TAK-438 shows a potent and longer-lasting inhibitory effect on the histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion in rats and dogs. TAK-438 shows significant antisecretory activity through high accumulation and slow clearance from the gastric tissue.

Target: Proton Pump
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Omeprazole virtually eliminated intragastric acidity in all patients: the median 24 hour intragastric pH rose from 1.4 to 5.3 and the mean hourly hydrogen ion activity fell from 38.50 to 1.95 mmol(mEq)/1 (p less than 0.001). This inhibition of 24 hour intragastric acidity is more profound than that previously reported with either cimetidine 1 g daily or ranitidine 300 mg daily [1]. The pharmacokinetics of omeprazole were studied in a group of healthy male subjects after single and repeated oral doses of 30 and 60 mg. Absorption of omeprazole from its enteric-coated formulation was unpredictable. There was a highly significant increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) after repeated dosing. Omeprazole increases its own relative availability following repeated dosing. This may be due to inhibition of gastric acid secretion by omeprazole which is an acid-labile compound [2].

Cefalexin (INN, BAN) or cephalexin (USAN, AAN) is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic introduced in 1967 by Eli Lilly and Company. It is an orally administered agent with a similar antimicrobial spectrum to the intravenous agents cefalotin and cefazolin. It was first marketed as Keflex (Lilly), and is marketed under several other trade names. As of 2008, cefalexin was the most popular cephalosporin antibiotic in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions of its generic versions alone, for US$255 million in sales (though less popular than two other antibiotics, amoxicillin and azithromycin, each with 50 million prescriptions per year).
Cefalexin is marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers under a wide range of brand names, including: Apo-Cephalex, Biocef, Cefanox, Ceforal, Cephabos, Cephalexin, Cephorum, Ceporex, Cilex, Ialex, Ibilex, Kefexin, Keflet, Keflex, Rekosporin, Keforal, Keftab, Keftal, Lopilexin, Larixin, Novo-Lexin, Ospexin, Tenkorex, Zephalexin, Panixine Disperdose, Rancef, Sialexin, Sporidex and Ulexin.

Target: Others
Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic marketed under the brand names Zytanix from Zydus Cadila, Zaroxolyn, and Mykrox. It is primarily used to treat congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. Metolazone indirectly decreases the amount of water reabsorbed into the bloodstream by the kidney, so that blood volume decreases and urine volume increases. This lowers blood pressure and prevents excess fluid accumulation in heart failure. Metolazone is sometimes used together with loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide, but these highly effective combinations can lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.
Metolazone and the other thiazide diuretics inhibit the function of the sodium-chloride symporter, preventing sodium and chloride, and therefore water too, from leaving the lumen to enter the tubule cell. As a result, water remains in the lumen and is excreted as urine, instead of being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Since most of the sodium in the lumen has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, thiazide diuretics have limited effects on water balance and on electrolyte levels. Nevertheless, they can be associated with low sodium levels, volume depletion, and low blood pressure, among other adverse effects.",C16H16ClN3O3S,10 mM in DMSO,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,O=S(C1=CC2=C(NC(C)N(C3=CC=CC=C3C)C2=O)C=C1Cl)(N)=O

Ketorolac or ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the family of heterocyclic acetic acid derivatives, used as an analgesic. Ketorolac acts by inhibiting the bodily synthesis of prostaglandins. Ketorolac in its oral (tablet or capsule) and intramuscular (injected) preparations is a racemic mixture of both (S)-(-)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (R)-(+)-ketorolac. An ophthalmic solution of ketorolac is available and is used to treat eye pain and to relieve the itchiness and burning of seasonal allergies.
The primary mechanism of action responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ketorolac is a non selective COX inhibitor. Ketorolac is indicated for short-term management of moderate to severe pain.Concerns about the high incidence of reported side effects led to restriction in its dosage and maximum duration of use. In the UK, treatment should be initiated only in a hospital.

Target: Alpha Adrenergic Receptor
Phentolamine Mesylate is a alpha 1- and alpha 2-blocking agent. Phentolamine leads to an increase in FBM by preferentially antagonizing presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoreceptors over postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. This influence of phentolamine on FBM may be secondary to its effect on ECoG. Promotion of LV-ECoG by catecholamines is mediated via an alpha 1-independent mechanism [1]. phentolamine increased catecholamine release by presynaptic alpha 2-blockade, thereby suppressing the autoinhibition of transmitter release. This excess of catecholamines causes a rise of oxygen consumption and vasodilation by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Under beta-blockade, this excess competitively counteracts the postsynaptic vascular alpha-blockade. The combination of pre- and postsynaptic effects invalidates the use of phentolamine in the assessment of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor tone [2].",C18H23N3O4S,10 mM in DMSO,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,CS(O)(=O)=O.CC1=CC=C(N(C2=CC(O)=CC=C2)CC3=NCCN3)C=C1

Naltrexone is competitive antagonist for μ, κ, δ, and σ-opioid receptors, Naltrexone has greater oral efficacy and longer duration of action than naloxone.

Cefdinir is a third generation oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefdinir (Omnicef) is a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic in the third generation of the cephalosporin class, which is proved to be effective for common bacterial infections of the ear, sinus, throat, and skin. It can be used to treat infections caused by several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is available in US as Omnicef by Abbott Laboratories and in India as Cednir by Abbott, Kefnir by Glenmark and Cefdiel by Ranbaxy. As of 2008, cefdinir was the highest-selling cephalosporin antibiotic in the United States, with more than US$585 million in retail sales of its generic versions alone.
Cefdinir, a new oral 2-amino-5-thiazolyl cephalosporin, inhibited the luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (LACL) response of human neutrophils stimulated by PMA but not opsonized zymosan, in a concentration-dependent but not time-dependent manner. The LACL response to opsonized zymosan in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils was, however, inhibited by cefdinir. Furthermore, cefdinir inhibited LACL generation in cell-free systems consisting of H2O2, NaI, and either horseradish peroxidase or a myeloperoxidase-containing neutrophil extract.

Neither deracoxib nor piroxicam induced sufficient toxicity in fibroblasts to reach an IC50. Exposure of osteosarcoma cells to cytotoxic concentrations of deracoxib and piroxicam did not result in DNA fragmentation [1]. Concomitant treatment of cells with piroxicam and deracoxib resulted in significant induction of apoptosis at lower concentrations and accumulation of cells in the G /G  phase. Significant cytotoxic effects exhibited by the combination of piroxicam and deracoxib against canine mammary carcinoma cells in vitro suggest an attractive approach for the treatment of canine mammary carcinoma [2].

Methylscopolamine is an oral medication used along with other medications to treat peptic ulcers by reducing stomach acid secretion. With the advent of proton pump inhibitors and antihistamine medications it is rarely used for this. It can also be used for stomach or intestinal spasms, to reduce salivation, and to treat motion sickness. From Wikipedia.
Methscopolamine (Pamine), an anti-acetylcholine drug, prevented ulcer formation, reduced further volume and acid output but produced a 3-4 fold increase in hexosamine concentration. Tissue (corpus and antrum) hexosamine was moderately reduced by restraint. In the corpus, this was counteracted by methscopolamine but antrum hexosamine was not influenced by this drug. The anti-ulcer property of methscopolamine may be due not only to its effect on acid secretion but also to the rise in gastric mucus concentration that it produced [1].",C18H24BrNO4,DMSO: ≥ 34 mg/mL,Inflammation/Immunology,Launched,C[N+]1([C@@H]2[C@H](O3)[C@H]3[C@H]1C[C@@H](OC([C@@H](C4=CC=CC=C4)CO)=O)C2)C.[Br-]

in vitro: Glycopyrrolate showed no selectivity in its binding to the M1-M3 receptors. Kinetics studies, however, showed that glycopyrrolate dissociates slowly from HASM muscarinic receptors (60% protection against [3H]-NMS binding at 30 nM) compared to ipratropium bromide [1].
in vivo: Glycopyrrolate (1 mg) tablets were then administered, starting with one tablet daily the third week and increasing the daily dose by one tablet per week until a maximum of four tablets during week six and 4 days of week seven when the daily dose was reduced to two tablets for 3 days. glycopyrrolate can be given in controlled doses provided that an adequate medical assessment has been undertaken [2]. Glycopyrrolate has a slow and erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal system, but even low plasma levels are associated with a distinct and long-lasting antisialogic effect [3]. Oral glycopyrrolate is emerging as a potential second-line treatment option, but experience with safety, efficacy, and dosing is especially limited in children [4]. phase III study, 52.3% of glycopyrrolate oral solution recipients (aged 3-18 years; n = 137) had an mTDS response (primary endpoint); the response rate was consistently above 50% at all 4-weekly timepoints, aside from the first assessment at week 4 (40.3%). In general, glycopyrrolate oral solution was well tolerated in clinical trials. The majority of adverse events were within expectations as characteristic anticholinergic outcomes [5].

in vitro: Cortisone suppressed this apoptosis at a concentration range of 1-10,000 ng/ml (2.8-28,000 nM) dose-dependently. Suppression of cortisol-induced apoptosis by cortisonewas consistently observed in PBMCs derived from 16 healthy subjects. Examination for inhibitory activities of the steroids against [3H]dexamethasone binding to PBMCs suggested that cortisone can bind cellular GC-receptors (GC-Rs), but the affinity of cortisone to GCRs is 1/30 or less than that of cortisol [1].  Apoptosis was also readily induced in primary cultures of third trimester decidual cells when treated with cortisol, cortisone, or dexamethasone (all 100 nM for 24 h) [2]. 
in vivo: The effects of a single dose of cortisone acetate (5 or 10 mg/100 g body weight) on B cells were examined in young chickens. A dose-dependent increase in numbers of circulating B lymphocytes and a change in their Ig-class distribution were followed by parallel increase in splenic plasma cells and serum immunoglobulins. The higher dose of cortisone produced changes in Bmu and Bgamma cells, whereas the lower dose primarily affected Bmu cells [3].  Adult female CD-1 mice received daily injections of cortisone acetate (0--50 mg/kg subcutaneously) and/or amphotericin B (0--12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) in a checkerboard combination dosage pattern for 30 days. Dosages of amphotericin B and cortisone acetate that produced little or no mortality individually produced significant (P less than 0.005) mortality in combination [4].

Benzotropine is a centrally-acting, antimuscarinic agent used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It may also be used to treat extrapyramidal reactions, such as dystonia and Parkinsonism, caused by antipsychotics. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease and extrapyramidal reactions arise from decreases in dopaminergic activity which creates an imbalance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity. Anticholinergic therapy is thought to aid in restoring this balance leading to relief of symptoms. In addition to its anticholinergic effects, benztropine also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine at nerve terminals via the dopamine transporter. Benzotropine also produces antagonistic effects at the histamine H1 receptor [1, 2].
Benztropine (BZT) and its analogues inhibit dopamine uptake and bind with moderate to high affinity to the dopamine transporter (DAT). BZT analogues also exhibit varied binding affinities for muscarinic M(1) and histamine H(1) receptors.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells.

Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects, or decreased heart muscle contractility, can be detected in vitro, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

Sumatriptan succinate is a serotonin1 (5-HT1) receptor agonist, which is effective in the acute treatment of migraine headache. Its antimigraine activity is believed to derive from selective vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels which are dilated and distended during migraine headache and/or from inhibition of neurogenically mediated inflammation in the dura mater [1].
For sumatriptan succinate 50 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 6.1, 7.5, and 4.0 for pain-free at two hours and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. NNTs for sustained pain-free and sustained headache relief during the 24 hours postdose were 9.5 and 6.0, respectively [2].

Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with IC50 of 5 nM [1]. Ramipril enhances the activity of ACE-associated CK2 and the phosphorylation of ACE Ser1270 in cultured endothelial cells, but is unable to activate JNK or stimulate the nuclear accumulation of c-Jun in endothelial cells expressing a S1270A ACE mutant or in ACE-deficient cells. Prolonged Ramipril treatment increases ACE expression in primary cultures of human endothelial cells and in vivo (mouse lung), which can be prevented by pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 [2].
Chronic in vivo administration of Ramipril to rats at a dosage that has similar hypotensive effects in vitro HUVECs significantly reduces the rate of LPS-induced apoptosis compared to the other ACE inhibitors, which contrasts with the apoptosis effect in vitro [3].

It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to a narrow spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it is often combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to β-lactamase resistance.

Prazosin, is a sympatholytic drug used to treat high blood pressure and anxiety, PTSD, andpanic disorder. It is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that is specific for the alpha-1 receptors. These receptors are found on vascular smooth muscle, where they are responsible for the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine. They are also found throughout the central nervous system. As of 2013, prazosin is off-patent in the US, and the FDA has approved at least one generic manufacturer.In addition to its alpha-blocking activity, prazosin is an antagonist of the MT3 receptor (which is not present in humans), with selectivity for this receptor over the MT1 and MT2 receptors.
Prazosin is orally active and has a minimal effect on cardiac function due to its alpha-1 receptor selectivity. However, when prazosin is initially started, heart rate and contractility go up in order to maintain the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when prazosin is taken for longer periods of time.

Target: P2Y Receptor
Clopidogrel is an effective antiplatelet agent useful for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular, cardiac, and peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel abolishes the inhibitory P2Y(AC) receptor-mediated ADP effects on prostaglandin E(1)-stimulated, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP without affecting epinephrine, thrombin, and thromboxane signaling. VASP phosphorylation is known to be closely correlated with the inhibition of platelet and fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) activation. Therefore, inhibition of the platelet P2Y(AC) ADP receptor and its intracellular signaling, including decreased VASP phosphorylation, is suggested as a molecular mechanism of clopidogrel action [1]. Clopidogrel ingestion reduced the thrombus volume significantly (p < 0.05) at 100 and 2600 s-1 (39 and 51% respectively). clopidogrel reduced significantly the fibrinopeptide A plasma levels and the fibrin deposition at shear rates below 650 s-1 [2]. Clopidogrel therapy resulted in a significant reduction in soluble CD40 ligand (p=0.03), a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory molecule derived mainly from activated platelets. However, clopidogrel therapy had no effect on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, or progenitor cells [3].

in vitro: High concentrations of flupirtine antagonized inward currents to NMDA(200 microM) at -70 mV with an lC50 against steady-state responses of 182.1+/-12.1 microM. The effects of flupirtine were voltage-independent and not associated with receptor desensitization making actions within the NMDA receptor channel or at the glycine modulatory site unlikely. NMDA receptor antagonism probably has little relevance for the clinical efficacy of flupirtine as the concentrations needed were far higher than those achieved in clinical practice. However, the activation of a G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel was identified as an interesting molecular target site of flupirtine. In the next stage, the central nervous spectrum of action of experimental K+ channel openers (PCO) was considered. As far as they have been studied, experimental K+ channel openers display a spectrum of action comparable to that of flupirtine [1]. Therapeutic flupirtine concentrations (≤10 μM) did not affect voltage-gated Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels, inward rectifier K(+) channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine or ionotropic glutamate receptors. Flupirtine shifted the gating of K(V)7 K(+) channels to more negative potentials and the gating of GABA(A) receptors to lower GABA concentrations [2]. Cell exposure to flupirtine decreased the amplitude of delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K(DR))) with a concomitant raise in current inactivation in NSC-34 neuronal cells [4].
in vivo: Rats were trained to discriminate the novel analgesic flupirtine (10.0 mg/kg i.p., 10 min) from no drug under a two-choice fixed-ratio 5 shock-termination schedule.

Aminophylline is a compound of the bronchodilator theophylline with ethylenediamine in 2:1 ratio. The ethylenediamine improves solubility, and the aminophylline is usually found as a dihydrate. Aminophylline is less potent and shorter-acting than theophylline. Its most common use is in the treatment of airway obstruction from asthma or COPD. It is used off-label as a reversal agent during nuclear stress testing. Aminophylline is a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
Adenosine is an endogenous extracellular messenger that can regulate myocardial oxygen needs. It acts through cellular surface receptors which effect intracellular signalling pathways to increase coronary artery blood flow, slow heart rate, block atrioventricular node conduction, suppress cardiac automaticity, and decrease β-adrenergic effects on contractility. Adenosine also antagonizes chronotropic and ionotropic effects of circulating catecholamines. Overall, adenosine decreases the heart's rate and force of contraction, which increases blood supply to the cardiac muscle. Given specific circumstances this mechanism (which is intended to protect the heart) may cause atropine-resistant refractory bradyasystole. Adenosine's effects are concentration-dependent. Adenosine's receptors are competitively antagonized by methylxanthines such as aminophylline. Aminophylline competitively antagonizes the cardiac actions of adenosine at the cell surface receptors.

Iloperidone displays affinity for dopamine D2 receptors and for 5-HT2A receptors and has a variety of in vivo activities suggestive of an atypical antipsychotic. Iloperidone displayed higher affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor (Ki = 7.1 nM) than for the dopamine D4 receptor (Ki = 25 nM). Iloperidone displayed high affinity for the 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors (Ki = 42.7 and 21.6 nM, respectively), and was found to have higher affinity for the 5-HT2A (Ki = 5.6 nM) than for the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 42.8 nM) [1]. Iloperidone was eliminated slowly, with a mean t1/2 of 13.5 to 14.0 hours. Coadministration with food did not significantly affect AUC, tmax, or Cmax. These results indicate that the rate of iloperidone's absorption is decreased, but the overall bioavailability is unchanged, when the drug is taken with food.

in vitro: Paliperidone inhibited MK-801 induced neurotoxicity both in MTT metabolism assay (p<0.01) and in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay (p<0.01).  Moreover, paliperidone could significantly retard MK-801-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth (p<0.01) and reverse MK-801-induced decreases of gene expression and phosphorylation of Akt1 and GSK3β (both p<0.01). Furthermore, these protective effects of paliperidone were blocked by pretreatment with a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [1]. paliperidone works finely at low concentrations (10 and 50 μM) against Aβ(25-35) and MPP(+) and solely protected SH-SY5Y from hydrogen peroxide. At 100 μM, paliperidone completely diminished cell reduction induced by different stressors, regardless of their dosages. Paliperidone was demonstrated with a higher oxidative stress-scavenging properties than other APDs in several aspects, such as generated bulk glutathione, low HNE, and protein carbonyl productions [2].

Pefloxacin is a synthetic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections.

It is a synthetic fluoroquinolone, belonging to the 3rd generation of quinolones. Pefloxacin is extensively prescribed in France. Pefloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States.
The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing.

In absence of R1881, bicalutamide partially activated VP16-AR-mediated transcription, indicative of AR binding to DNA. In LNCaP/AR-luc cells with a stably integrated AR-driven luciferase reporter construct, bicalutamide was unable to activate wtAR[1]. ARN-509 (IC50=16 nM) binds AR with 7- to 10-fold greater affinity than the clinically approved anti-androgen, bicalutamide (median IC50=160 nM), and competes for the same binding-site in the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor. 
in vivo: Ridaforolimus and bicalutamide combination treatment promotes cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. The effect of combination treatment was more pronounced, resulting in an almost complete G1 arrest in this cell line[2].

Lafutidine, a newly developed histamine H(2)-receptor antagonist, inhibits gastric acid secretion.It is currently marketed in Japan (Stogar) China (Lemeiting) and India (Lafaxid). It not only suppresses gastric acid secretion, but also has cytoprotective properties by the virtue of its property to induce the collagen synthesis in the gastric mucosa. It has a novel mechanism of action in addition to blocking the H2 receptors, it decreases inflammation by modulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vanilloid receptors. It is also found to stimulate mucin biosynthesis and promote the restitution of damaged mucosa.
Lafutidine is absorbed in the small intestine, reaches gastric cells via the systemic circulation, and then directly and rapidly binds to gastric cell histamine H2 receptors, thereby inhibiting the stimulation of cAMP and a resultant decrease in acid production (antisecretory action). It causes a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration in endothelial cells resulting in the release of Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP), which causes acid suppression by decreasing the vagal tone. Lafutidine also increases plasma somatostatin levels which decreases secretion of gastrin from G cells.

Doxapram (10 microM) was without effect on L-type Ca2+ channel currents recorded under conditions where K+ channel activity was minimized and was also without significant effect on K+ currents recorded in the neuronal cell line NG-108 15, suggesting a selective effect on carotid body type I cells.

Target: SSRIs
Fluvoxamine (maleate) is the maleate salt form of fluvoxamine, which is effective in inhibiting 5-HT uptake by blood platelets and brain synaptosomes. The antagonism by fluvoxamine of the reserpine-induced lowering of the pentamethylenetetrazole convulsive threshold can be regarded as due to an effect upon 5-HT uptake. In contrast to the effects of desmethylimipramine and imipramine, no stimulatory effects are found in rats when rapidly acting reserpine-like compounds are given following a dose of fluvoxamine [1]. fluvoxamine appears to improve combat-related PTSD symptoms but not depressive symptoms. The high attrition rate and lack of a placebo group limits the conclusions of our study. Controlled studies of fluvoxamine in the treatment of PTSD are warranted [2]. Fluvoxamine was less potent at decreasing ethanol self-administration when food was available concurrently versus when ethanol was available in isolation [ED50: 4.0 (2.7-5.9) and 5.1 (4.3-6.0)]. Effects on food were similar under each condition in which food was available. The results demonstrate that the potency of fluvoxamine in reducing ethanol-maintained behavior depends on whether ethanol is available in isolation or in the context of concurrently scheduled food reinforcement [3].

It is among the secondary metabolites of plants from Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants, such as henbane, jimson weed (Datura), angel's trumpets (Brugmansia), and corkwood (Duboisia). Scopolamine exerts its effects by acting as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically M1 receptors; it is thus classified as an anticholinergic, antimuscarinic drug. 
Its use in medicine is relatively limited, with its chief uses being in the treatment of motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine is named after the plant genus Scopolia.

Pitavastatin (usually as a calcium salt) is a member of the blood cholesterol lowering medication class of statins, marketed in the United States under the trade name Livalo. Like other statins, it is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the first step of cholesterolsynthesis. It has been available in Japan since 2003, and is being marketed under licence in South Korea and in India. It is likely that pitavastatin will be approved for use in hypercholesterolaemia (elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood) and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease outside South and Southeast Asia as well. In the US, it received FDA approval in 2009.       
Most statins are metabolised in part by one or more hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to an increased potential for drug interactions and problems with certain foods (such as grapefruit juice). Pitavastatin appears to be a substrate of CYP2C9, and not CYP3A4 (which is a common source of interactions in other statins).

Glipizide is an oral rapid- and short-acting anti-diabetic drug from the sulfonylurea class. It is classified as a second generation sulfonylurea, which means that it undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Mechanism of action is produced by blocking potassium channels in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. By partially blocking the potassium channels, the cell remains depolarized, increasing the time the cell spends in the calcium release stage, which results in signaling leading to calcium influx. The increase in calcium will initiate more insulin release from each beta cell. Sulfonylureas may also cause the decrease of serum glucagon and potentiate the action of insulin at the extrapancreatic tissues [1, 2].",C21H27N5O4S,10 mM in DMSO,Metabolic Disease,Launched,O=C(C1=NC=C(C)N=C1)NCCC2=CC=C(S(=O)(NC(NC3CCCCC3)=O)=O)C=C2

The fluorine substitution at position 9 in the steroid nucleus greatly enhances its activity. A typical dosage strength used in dermatology is 0.01-0.025%. One such cream is sold under the brand name Flucort-N and includes the antibiotic neomycin. The Glucocorticoid Receptor(GR) binding affinity (IC50) for Fluocinolone Acetonide(FA) was 2.0 nM, respectively. The values is similar to the GR transactivation EC50 of 0.7 nM for FA, respectively [1, 2].",C24H30F2O6,DMSO: ≥ 31 mg/mL,Inflammation/Immunology,Launched,O=C([C@]([C@@]1([H])C[C@@]2([H])[C@@](C[C@H](F)C3=CC4=O)([H])[C@@](F)([C@]3(C=C4)C)[C@@H](O)C5)(OC(C)(C)O1)[C@]25C)CO

Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril hydrochloride is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [1].
Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham STNx group (control), STNx group, morning benazepril hydrochloride group (MB) and evening benazepril hydrochloride group (EB).Benazepril hydrochloride was intragastrically administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day at 07:00 and 19:00 in the MB group and EB group respectively for 12 weeks. All the animals were synchronized to the light:dark cycle of 12:12 for 12 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), 24-h urinary protein excretion and renal function were measured at 11 weeks. Blood samples and kidneys were collected every 4 h throughout a day to detect the expression pattern of renin activity (RA), angiotensin II (AngII) and aldosterone (Ald) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the mRNA expression profile of clock genes (bmal1, dbp and per2) by real-time PCR at 12 weeks. Our results showed that no significant differences were noted in the SBP, 24-h urine protein excretion and renal function between the MB and EB groups. There were no significant differences in average Ald and RA content of a day between the MB group and EB group. The expression peak of bmal1 mRNA was phase-delayed by 4 to 8 h, and the diurnal variation of per2 and dbp mRNA diminished in the MB and EB groups compared with the control and STNx groups. It was concluded when the similar SBP reduction, RAAS inhibition and clock gene profile were achieved with optimal dose of benazepril hydrochloride, morning versus evening dosing of benazepril hydrochloride has the same renoprotection effects [2].

Ziprasidone (hydrochloride) is the salt form of ziprasidone, which possesses an in vitro 5-HT2A/dopamine D2 receptor affinity ratio higher than any clinically available antipsychotic agent. In vivo, ziprasidone antagonizes 5-HT2A receptor-induced head twitch with 6-fold higher potency than for blockade of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a measure of central dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Ziprasidone also has high affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes, which may further enhance its therapeutic potential [1]. Ziprasidone sulfoxide and sulfone were the major metabolites in human serum. The affinities of the sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites for 5-HT2 and D2 receptors are low with respect to ziprasidone, and are thus unlikely to contribute to its antipsychotic effects [2].

Almotriptan inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in HeLa cells transfected with 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(1D) human receptors [1]. Almotriptan had a mild antiemetic effect and a slight, transient diuretic effect in dogs, although the latter effect is probably of no clinical relevance. In addition, no effect on the respiratory system of conscious guinea pigs was observed following almotriptan treatment.

Target: Nav1.5 channel
Flecainide is a class 1C antiarrhythmic drug especially used for the management of supraventricular arrhythmia. Flecainide works by blocking the Nav1.5 sodium channel in the heart, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential.
in vitro: Under the current-clamp condition, flecainide (1-100 microM) prolonged the action potential duration at both the early and the late phases of repolarization in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the resting membrane potential [1]. At a holding potential (HP) of -120 mV, flecainide use-dependently blocked WT and G1306E I(Na) equally but was more potent on R1448C channels. For WT, the extent of block depended on a holding voltage more negative than the activation threshold, being greater at -90 mV as compared to -120 and -180 mV [2].
in vivo: Flecainide (80-130 mg/m(2) orally) resulted in termination of the tachycardia in all 8 patients. Acute pharmacological termination of arrhythmia occurred with oral flecainide loading in 1 and temporarily with intravenous esmolol loading in 1 patient. Adjuvant therapy in form of propranolol was used in 5 and digoxin in 2 [3].

Silibinininduced cell death was attenuated by antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Trolox, suggesting that the effect of silibinin was dependent on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2]. SIL treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HCC cell viability, SIL exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration, intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, caspase3 activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). SIL treatment decreased the expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), RBP-Jκ, and Hes1 proteins, upregulated the apoptosis pathway-related protein Bax, and downregulated Bcl2, survivin, and cyclin D1. Notch1 siRNA (in vitro) or DAPT (a known Notch1 inhibitor, in vivo) further enhanced the antitumor activity of SIL, and recombinant Jagged1 protein (a known Notch ligand in vitro) attenuated the antitumor activity of SIL [3].

Azlocillin (12.5 μg/mL) inhibits over 75% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Azlocillin (12.5 μg/mL) is also active against indole-negative and -positive Proteus spp., inhibiting 98 and 71%, respectively. Azlocillin is more active than mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and carbenicillin and as active as BLP-1654 against isolates of P. aeruginosa [1]. The acyl side chains of Azlocillin have an ureido-(urea) structurehence the name ""ureidopenicillins"" or, more specifically, ""acylureidopenicillins."" In vitro studies against P. aeruginosa demonstrates that piperacillin has activity that is twice that of azlocillin, 4 times that of mezlocillin and ticarcillin, and about 8 times that of carbenicillin. Azlocillin produces elongated bacterial forms with delayed or no lysis in morphologic studies [2].
Azlocillin has MICs of 12.5 μg/mL on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Azlocillin (3.125 μg/mL) results in a reduction in the rate of growth but no bactericidal phase on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Azlocillin decreases an initial lag phase with increasing drug concentration. At the lower concentration of tobramycin (0.5 μg/ml), the combinations with both the high and the low concentrations of Azlocillin are more effective than the individual components on Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3]. Isolates with derepression of AmpC enzyme are one to two doubling dilutions more resistant to azlocillin than are those in which increased efflux or impermeability is inferred. Those with secondary β-lactamases are mostly (12/14 cases) susceptible to ceftazidime at 4 mg/L, but are amongst the most resistant to Azlocillin (MIC ≥128 mg/L in 10/14 cases) [4].",C20H22N5NaO6S,10 mM in DMSO,Infection,Launched,O=C([C@@H](C(C)(C)S[C@]1([H])[C@@H]2NC([C@H](NC(N3CCNC3=O)=O)C4=CC=CC=C4)=O)N1C2=O)[O-].[Na+]

Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug. The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting weight loss is definite, though modest.

Sertaconazole nitrate reduces the release of cytokines from activated lymphocytes and mitigated inflammation in animal models of irritant contact dermatitis and neurogenic inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion. Sertaconazole nitrate is found to inhibit the proliferation of stimulated human lymphocytes with IC50 of 4 μg/mL [1]. Sertaconazole nitrate inhibits ergosterol synthesis by blockade of the P450-dependent enzyme pathway that catalyzes the methylation of lanosterol to ergosterol, thus inhibits fungal cell growth. Sertaconazole nitrate binds directly to nonsterol lipids in the membrane, which interferes with the regulation of the permeability of fungal cell membranes, thus induces fungal cell death [2].
The mean ear weight of Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)-challenged murine treated with sertaconazole nitrate (1%) is 7.23 mg compared with 14.7 mg for controls, indicating a statistically significant reduction in irritant dermatitis. Sertaconazole nitrate 1% elicits a significant reduction in Resiniferatoxin-induced ear edema when compared with controls in CD-1 mice. Topical treatment with sertaconazole nitrate 1% significantly inhibits contact hypersensitivity and decreases the content of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-2, and IFNγ in oxazolone exposed murine skin [1]. Clinical trials with sertaconazole nitrate cream 2% show efficacy in the treatment of superficial cutaneous fungal infections [2].

Raloxifene activates TGF beta 3 promoter as a full agonist at nanomolar concentrations, and raloxifene inhibits the estrogen response element-containing vitellogenin promoter expression as a pure estrogen antagonist in transient transfection assays [1]. Raloxifene, has been demonstrated as a potent uncompetitive inhibitor of human liver aldehyde oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of phthalazine, vanillin, and nicotine-Delta1'(5')-iminium ion, with Ki values of 0.87 nM, 1.2 nM and 1.4 nM. Raloxifene has also been shown to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of an aldehyde oxidase-catalyzed reduction reaction of a hydroxamic acid-containing compound, with a Ki of 51 nM [2]. 
Raloxifene (3 mg/kg/day) has potent estrogenic activity on bone resorption and serum cholesterol, a lesser effect on bone formation, and minimal activity on uterine wet weight in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. [3]. Raloxifene (0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg, orally for 5 weeks) increases bone mineral density in the distal femur and proximal tibia in ovariectomized (OVX) rat. Raloxifene reduces serum cholesteroloral with ED50 of 0.2 mg/kg in ovariectomized (OVX) rat. Raloxifene diverges dramatically from estrogen in its lack of significant estrogenic effects on uterine tissue [4]. Raloxifene prevents cancellous osteopenia as well as the changes in radial bone growth, bone resorption, and blood cholesterol, but is less effective in reducing cancellous bone formation and does not prevent uterine atrophy in ovariectomized (OVX) rats [5].",C28H28ClNO4S,10 mM in DMSO,Endocrinology,Launched,O=C(C1=C(C2=CC=C(O)C=C2)SC3=CC(O)=CC=C31)C4=CC=C(OCCN5CCCCC5)C=C4.Cl

Loperamide is an effective therapy for a variety of diarrheal syndromes. Loperamide is generally well tolerated at recommended nonprescription doses, with the most common side effects related to the impact on bowel motility (abdominal pain, distention, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) [1, 2]. Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine; by itself it does not affect the central nervous system. It works similarly to morphine, by decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which in turn decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the amount of time substances stay in the intestine, allowing for more water to be absorbed out of the fecal matter. Loperamide also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex.[3]",C29H34Cl2N2O2,10 mM in DMSO,Neurological Disease,Launched,O=C(N(C)C)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)(C2=CC=CC=C2)CCN3CCC(O)(C4=CC=C(Cl)C=C4)CC3.Cl

Target: Angiotensin Receptor Type-1(AT1)
in vitro: Eprosartan mesylate, is one of the highly selective, orally active, non-peptide angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists [1]. In rat and human adrenal cortical membranes, Eprosartan displaced specifically bound [125I]AII with IC50 of 9.2 and 3.9 nM, respectively. Eprosartan also inhibited [125I]AII binding to human liver membranes (IC50 = 1.7 nM) and to rat mesenteric artery membranes (IC50 = 1.5 nM). In rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, Eprosartan caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of AII-induced increases in intracellular Ca++ levels. In rabbit aortic rings [2].
in vivo: Administration of Eprosartan (3-10 mg/kg) intraduodenally or intragastrically to conscious normotensive rats resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor response to AII (250 ng/kg, i.v.). At 10 mg/kg, i.d., significant inhibition of the pressor response to AII was observed for 3 hr. In this same rat model, Eprosartan had no effect on base-line pressure or on the pressor response to norepinephrine or vasopressin [2]. Eprosartan is highly effective and safe in lowering blood pressure, notably SBP, in older subjects with mild to moderate hypertension [3]. Treatment with eprosartan in once-daily doses up to 1200 mg alone or in combination with HCTZ was well tolerated, with dizziness and asthenia being the most common side effects [4]. Therapy with eprosartan mesilat was associated with significant hypotensive effect (more evident in patients with high systolic blood pressure), improvement in 24-hour blood pressure profile and quality of life, and lower probability of secondary stroke. Side effects were not observed [5].",C24H28N2O7S2,DMSO: ≥ 48 mg/mL,Cardiovascular Disease,Launched,OC(/C(CC1=CC=CS1)=C/C2=CN=C(CCCC)N2CC3=CC=C(C(O)=O)C=C3)=O.CS(=O)(O)=O

Target: Calcium Channel
Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. Experimental data suggest amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects, or decreased heart muscle contractility, can be detected in vitro, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

in vitro: Dutasteride inhibited (3)H-T conversion to (3)H-DHT and, as anticipated, inhibited T-induced secretion of PSA and proliferation. However the drug also inhibited DHT-induced PSA secretion and cell proliferation (IC(50) approximately 1 microM). Dutasteride competed for binding the LNCaP cell AR with an IC(50) approximately 1.5 microM. High concentrations of dutasteride (10-50 microM), but not finasteride, in steroid-free medium, resulted in enhanced cell death, possibly by apoptosis [1].

Ciclesonide (CIC) is an inhaled glucocorticosteroid. CIC (5 microM) was rapidly hydrolyzed by NHBE cells (approximately 30% conversion at 4h), with almost complete conversion by 24h. In liver and NHBE cells, major involvement of cytosolic carboxylesterases, with some contribution by cholinesterases, was indicated. The highest level of conversion was found in the liver, the site of inactivation of des-CIC through rapid oxidation by cytochrome P450. Carboxylesterases in bronchial epithelial cells probably contribute significantly to the conversion to des-CIC in the target organ, whereas low systemic levels of des-CIC are a result of the high metabolic clearance by the liver following CIC inhalation [1].

Asdelavirdine concentration was increased from 0 to 100 microM, the K(M) for diclofenac metabolism rose from 4.5+/-0.5 to 21+/-6 microM, and V(max) declined from 4.2+/-0.1 to 0.54+/-0.08 nmol/min/mg of protein, characteristic of mixed-type inhibition [2].
in vivo: The mean values (+/- standard deviations) for the maximum concentration in serum (C(max)) of ritonavir, the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)), and the minimum concentration in serum (C(min)) of ritonavir before the addition of delavirdine were 14.8 +/- 6.7 micro M, 94 +/- 36 micro M. h, and 3.6 +/- 2.1 micro M, respectively. These same parameters were increased to 24.6 +/- 13.9 micro M, 154 +/- 83 micro M. h, and 6.52 +/- 4.85 micro M, respectively, after the addition of delavirdine(P is <0.05 for all comparisons). Delavirdine pharmacokinetic parameters in the presence of ritonavir included a C(max) of 23 +/- 16 micro M, an AUC(0-8) of 114 +/- 75 micro M. h, and a C(min) of 9.1 +/- 7.5 micro M [3].

Potential advantages of eltrombopag may include a sustained platelet response and a good tolerability profile.

Eltrombopag stimulates the growth of TPO-dependent cell lines via JAK2 and STAT signaling pathways and stimulates isolated human CD34+ cells to become megakaryocytes and produce platelets [2].
in vivo: Twelve weeks of antiviral therapy, with concurrent receipt of eltrombopag or placebo, were completed by 36%, 53%, and 65% of patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg of eltrombopag, respectively, and by 6% of patients in the placebo group [3].

Target: Calcium Channel
Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the movement of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. Experimental data suggest amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects, or decreased heart muscle contractility, can be detected in vitro, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

in vivo: In mice the intrathecal injection of SP elicited the typical scratching, biting and licking response that was dose-dependently inhibited by Netupitant given intraperitoneally in the 1-10mg/kg dose range. In gerbils, foot tapping behavior evoked by the intracerebroventricular injection of a NK(1) agonist was dose-dependently counteracted by Netupitant given intraperitoneally (ID(50) 1.5mg/kg) or orally (ID(50) 0.5mg/kg) [3].",C30H32F6N4O,DMSO: 23.2 mg/mL (Need ultrasonic and warming),Neurological Disease,Launched,CN1CCN(C2=CC(C3=C(C)C=CC=C3)=C(N(C)C(C(C4=CC(C(F)(F)F)=CC(C(F)(F)F)=C4)(C)C)=O)C=N2)CC1

Tigecycline is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species including clinically important multidrug-resistant nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial pathogens. Tigecycline has been shown to inhibit the translation elongation step by binding to the ribosome 30S subunit and preventing aminoacylated tRNAs to accommodate in the ribosomal A site [1]. Tigecycline has also been found to be effective for the treatment of community- as well as hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia, sepsis with shock and urinary tract infections. Tigecycline appears to be a valuable treatment option for the management of superbugs,  especially where conventional therapy has failed [2].
Fifteen patients received tigecycline for 16 episodes of CPKP infection. The main infections were pneumonia (31%), urinary tract infection (31%), peritonitis (20%), catheter-related bacteraemia (12%), and meningitis (6%). Most infections were complicated with severe sepsis (44%), septic shock (12%), and/or bacteraemia (19%). The daily maintenance dose of tigecycline was 200 mg in 10 episodes and 100 mg in 6 episodes.

Mosapride is a gastroprokinetic agent that acts as a selective 5HT4 agonist.

It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach (i.e. at least one hour before food or two hours after food).
In addition to its prokinetic properties, mosapride also exerts anti-inflammatory effects on the gastrointestinal tract which may contribute to some of its therapeutic effects. Mosapride also promotes neurogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract which may prove useful in certain bowel disorders. The neurogenesis is due to mosapride's effect on the 5-HT4 receptor where it acts as an agonist.Its common side effects include dry mouth, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, insomnia, malaise, nausea, diarrhoea and sometimes constipation. Unlike some other prokinetic agents, mosapride has little effect on potassium channels, no effect on hERG transfected cells, and no effect on cardiovascular function that could be detected in tests on humans.

Target: nAChR
Vecuronium (Norcuron) is a muscle relaxant in the category of non-depolarizing blocking agents. Vecuronium bromide is indicated as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. In adolescents the vecuronium requirement was less than in children and was comparable to that reported in adults in other studies (89 +/- 13 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1) [1]. Infusions of Vecuronium provided much smoother control of neuromuscular blockade than did pancuronium. No cardiovascular side-effects were noted even at the greatest dose (0.12 mg kg-1) used. Vecuronium has clear advantages over pancuronium and represents a potentially valuable addition to the armamentarium of clinically useful muscle relaxants [2]. The onset times of the 0.6 and 0.9 mg x kg(-1) of Org 9426 groups were 84.6 and 77.1 sec respectively, which showed statistical difference between the onset time of 0.1 mg x kg(-1) of vecuronium, 125.7 sec.

Natamycin has a very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. There is an MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of less than 10 ppm for most molds. Natamycin is classified as a macrolide polyene antifungal and, as a drug, is used to treat fungal keratitis. It is especially effective against Aspergillus and Fusarium corneal infections. Other common members of the polyene macrolide antifungal family are amphotericin B, nystatin, and filipin. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a natural preservative.
Natamycin is used to treat fungal infections, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium and Penicillium. It is applied as a cream, in eyedrops, or (for oral infections) in a lozenge.

Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor marketed since 1999 for the treatment of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). Despite its clinical efficacy, abacavir administration has been associated with serious and sometimes fatal toxic events. Abacavir has been reported to undergo bioactivation in vitro, yielding reactive species that bind covalently to human serum albumin, but the haptenation mechanism and its significance to the toxic events induced by this anti-HIV drug have yet to be elucidated. 
The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft.

in vitro: It was found that 10 uM amiodarone induces accumulation of ethidium bromide (5 ug/ml) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. At the same time, in yeast cells with inactivated MDR genes, accumulation of ethidium bromide was 6-fold higher even without amiodarone. Addition of non-lethal concentrations of amiodarone to MDR-deficient cells caused an increase of intracellular ethidium bromide to the level, which was even lower than the level in amiodarone-treated wild-type cells [2].  Cells treated with amiodarone were seen to have detached from the dish, with cell rounding, cytoplasmic blebbing and irregularity in shape. An increase in the sub-G1 phase fraction, from 15.43 to 21.34% and 79.83% and a reduction in the G1 phase fraction, from 48.83 to 41.63% and 11.52%, were observed in cells treated with amiodarone at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM, respectively [3].
in vivo: Chronic treatment with oral amiodarone for 4 weeks reduced i.p. when myocytes were dialyzed with patch-pipettes containing either 10 mM Na+ or 80 mM Na+. In myocytes from untreated rabbits, acute exposure to amiodarone in vitro reduced i.p. when patch pipettes contained 10 mM Na+ but had no effect on i.p. at 80 mM Na+.

in vitro: Itraconazole is pharmacologically distinct from other azole antifungal agents in that it is the only inhibitor in this class that has been shown to inhibit both the hedgehog signaling pathway and angiogenesis[1, 2]. These distinct activities are unrelated to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and the exact molecular targets responsible remain unidentified. Functionally, the antiangiogenic activity of itraconazole has been shown to be linked to inhibition of glycosylation, VEGFR2 phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways [2].Evidence suggests the structural determinants for inhibition of hedgehog signaling by itraconazole are recognizably different from those associated with antiangiogenic activity [3].
in vivo: Nine volunteers were given either 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, itraconazole increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve from 10 to 15 times (p < 0.001) and mean peak concentrations three to four times (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo phase. In psychomotor tests, the interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05) until at least 6 hours after drug administration.

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has an antimicrobial spectrum similar to or slightly wider than that of penicillin, and is often prescribed for people who have an allergy to penicillins. For respiratory tract infections, it has better coverage of atypical organisms, including Mycoplasma and legionellosis. It was first marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, and it is today commonly known as EES (erythromycin ethylsuccinate, an ester prodrug that is commonly administered). It is also occasionally used as a prokinetic agent.
Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. Erythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations, but the mechanism is not fully understood. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial 70s rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied and, thus, the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action.",C37H67NO13,DMSO: ≥ 40 mg/mL,Infection,Launched,C[C@@H]([C@@H]([C@H](C(O[C@@H]1CC)=O)C)O[C@@](O[C@@H](C)[C@@H]2O)([H])C[C@@]2(C)OC)[C@H]([C@](O)(C[C@H](C([C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@@]1(O)C)C)=O)C)C)O[C@@](O[C@H](C)C[C@@H]3N(C)C)([H])[C@@H]3O

Target:  factor Xa
Edoxaban is an oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, an elderly population that frequently receives aspirin (ASA) and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for concurrent illnesses[1].
in vitro: Edoxaban PK was not affected by concomitant low-dose ASA or naproxen, but high-dose ASA increased systemic exposure of edoxaban by approximately 30%. The effects of edoxaban on prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, anti-FXa, and intrinsic FXa activity were not influenced by administration with ASA or naproxen. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by high-dose ASA, low-dose ASA, or naproxen was not affected by edoxaban[1].
in vivo: Forty-eight subjects, aged 18 to 45 years, received either edoxaban 60 mg once daily × 7 days (n = 24) or digoxin 0.25 mg twice daily × 2 days and once daily × 5 days (n = 24) and then concomitantly for 7 days. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for digoxin and edoxaban concentrations on days 7 and 14. Serial coagulation assays were measured for edoxaban on days 7 and 14. Edoxaban PK parameters demonstrated mild increases in area under the curve and peak concentrations of 9.5% and 15.6%, respectively[2],

Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia (especially atypical pneumonias associated with Chlamydophila pneumoniae), skin and skin structure infections. Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibits the translation of peptides. Clarithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila. Besides this bacteriostatic effect, clarithromycin also has bactericidal effect on certain strains, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Clarithromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Even low doses of the cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor clarithromycin increase the plasma concentrations and effects of repaglinide.

Atazanavir sulfate is a sulfate salt form of atazanavir that is an highly potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor.

In subjects with HIV, atazanavir (400 mg once daily) produced rapid and sustained improvements in viral load and CD4 counts in both antiretroviral-naive as well as previously treated patients when used in combination with dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment [1].
After intravenous (iv), oral (po) and intraportal (ip) administration of ATV at a dosage of 7 mg/kg, AUCs in HL rats were 12.41, 5.24 and 8.89 microg/mLh, respectively, and were significantly higher than those in control rats (4.09, 1.70 and 3.38 microg/mLh). Despite the decrease of distribution volume (Vd(ss)), the terminal half-life (t(1/2)) in HL tended to be shorter than in control, and hepatic distribution of ATV in HL rats was 4.8-fold increases. These results suggested that the uptake of ATV into liver might counteract the decrease of Vd(ss). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in bioavailability, and the lymphatic transport to AUC showed no statistical change. In conclusion, although the protein binding rate and AUC were significantly increased, the pharmacokinetics of ATV might be tolerated in HL [2].

Target: Others
Pimecrolimus blocks T-lymphocyte activation pathway by inhibiting calcineurin function [1]. Pimecrolimus prevents the release of cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells. Pimecrolimus binds to macrophilin-12, the pimecrolimusmacrophilin complex then binds to the cytosolic enzyme calcineurin phosphatase. The pimecrolimus-macrophilin complex prevents the dephosphorylation of the cytoplasmic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells by inhibiting the action of calcineurin. Pimecrolimus inhibits not only the transcription and synthesis of cytokines from mast cells, but also the release of preformed mediators serotonin and β-hexosaminidase by the inhibition of Fcε-RI-mediated degranulation and secretion. Pimecrolimus treatment causes a strong down-regulation of the expression of mRNA for genes associated with the macrolactam target pathway and inflammation [2].
Pimecrolimus is found to be as effective as cyclosporine A following oral ingestion and slightly superior after subcutaneous administration in mice. Pimecrolimus contrasts cyclosporine A and tacrolimus by inhibiting ongoing secondary inflammatory response, but not impairing the primary immune response in allergic contact dermatitis in mice. [2] Pimecrolimus is as effective as the high-potency corticosteroid clobetasol-17-propionate in a pig model of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).

Target: Others
Guanidine HCl is the most popular protein denaturant. Analysis of unfolding transitions by Guanidine HCl provides several important parameters regarding the mechanism of conformational stability of proteins. Guanidine HCl at low concentrations refolds acid-unfolds apomyoglobin and cytochrome c, stabilizing the molten globule state. Guanidine HCl (> 1 M) causes co-operative unfolding of the molten globule state [1]. Guanidine HCl at millimolar concentrations, is able to causes efficient loss of the normally stable [PSI+] element from yeast cells. 5 mM Guanidine HCl in growth media cures [PSI+] and other prions of yeast. 5 mM Guanidine HCl significantly reduces Hsp104-mediated basal and acquired thermotolerance by 30-fold and 50 fold, respectively. Guanidine HCl also reduces the ability of Hsp104 to restore activity of thermally denatured luciferase [2].",CH6ClN3,10 mM in DMSO,Metabolic Disease,Launched,NC(N)=N.Cl
