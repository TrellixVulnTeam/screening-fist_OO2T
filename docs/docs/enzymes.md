# Enzymes

## Summary

This page contains the methods for producing the enzymes used in this screening program.
The enzymes are variants of the Cytochrome P450 BM3:

| ID | Mutations | PDB  |
|----|-----------|------|
| WT |           | 1BU7 |
|A82F|   A82F    | 4KEW |
| DM | A82F/F87V | 4KEY |
|1YQO|   T268A   | 1YQO |
|1YQP|   T268N   | 1YQP |

The page shows the method used to create the mutant BM3 expression plasmid DNA, 
expression of the mutants in *E. coli* and their purification.

## Aims

- Create expression plasmids containing the target mutants from an in-house starting point - [bm3-wt.gb]().
	- Sequence the plasmids to confirm they carry the mutations
- Express the mutants in *E. coli* using those plasmids.
- Purify the mutant protein from the *E. coli* harvest.


## DNA

### Starting Material

An heirloom BM3 Wild-type (heme domain) expression plasmid, [bm3-wt.gb](), 
was inherited and used as the basis for DNA work in this project.
The plasmid is a **?** pET15(?) expression vector where the BM3 gene has a 6xHis purification tag at the N-terminus,
flanked by a T7 promoter and terminator which leads to high yields in strains of *E. coli* containing the T7 RNA polymers.
The plasmid also encodes ampicillin resistance and a ? replication origin which leads to a low copy number.
