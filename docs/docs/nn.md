# Model

## Summary

This page describes the deep learning model constructed for this project.
The model is designed to estimate the likelihood of a binding interaction between a given Cytochrome P450 sequence and a ligand SMILES code.
The intended end uses of the model are:

1. Virtually screening sequences for potential activity with a given compound.
2. Optimally design an enzyme-ligand screening experiment.

## Data

It was important to improve the sample efficiency of the model as far as possible, given the cost of lab data acquisition.
This was done by:

1. Application of a pre-trained model
2. Further pre-training the model on task-specific data
