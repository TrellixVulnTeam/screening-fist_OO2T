# Screening Fist

## About
Screening Fist is an enzyme:compound screening program focussed on mutants of the P450 BM3 and pharamceutical compounds.
Binding data generated here is used to train a predictive binding model which itself is used to design subsequent screening rounds based on expected information gain.
