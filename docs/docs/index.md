# Screening Fist

## About

Screening fist is a machine-guided enzyme-substrate screening program.
It uses a simple, high throughput P450 binding assay to identify "hits" between P450 BM3 mutants and drug-like compounds.
The data is used to train a machine learning model that designs subsequent screening rounds.
The model can also be used to estimate the substrate specificity of a given mutant, which can be useful in enzyme design.
