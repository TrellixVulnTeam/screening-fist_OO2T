# 01 - P450 BM3 Wild-Type vs Full Library

## Aim

Screen entire FDA library against P450 BM3 Wild-Type.

Use more than 4 concentrations for each compound. 

Not all of the data will be useable because some of the compounds interfere with measurement, but these edge cases can be caught for process development.
