# assay development

The assay was developed over a couple years with interruptions and the notes/data from that is messy! This directory attempts to clean it up a bit. 
To see the old development work in all its hideous glory then check [`../.old`](../.old).

## development overview

1. pilot tests
2. buffer tests
3. `echo` - picklist design
4. `plates` - data analysis
5. validation
